In cases where no \\nformality exists, the body of knowledge is “gen -\\nerally recognized” by practitioners and may \\nbe codified in a variety of ways for a variety of \\ndifferent uses. But in many cases, a guide to a \\nbody of knowledge is formally documented, usu-\\nally in a form that permits it to be used for such \\npurposes as development and accreditation of \\nacademic and training programs, certification of \\nspecialists, or professional licensing. Generally, \\na professional society or similar body maintains \\nstewardship of the formal definition of a body of \\nknowledge.\\nDuring the past forty-five years, software engi-\\nneering has evolved from a conference catch -\\nphrase into an engineering profession, character -\\nized by 1) a professional society, 2) standards that \\nspecify generally accepted professional practices, \\n3) a code of ethics, 4) conference proceedings, \\n5) textbooks, 6) curriculum guidelines and cur -\\nricula, 7) accreditation criteria and accredited \\ndegree programs, 8) certification and licensing, \\nand 9) this Guide to the Body of Knowledge.\\nIn this Guide\\u2008to\\u2008the\\u2008Software\\u2008Engineering\\u2008Body\\u2008\\nof\\u2008Knowledge, the IEEE Computer Society pres -\\nents a revised and updated version of the body of \\nknowledge formerly documented as SWEBOK \\n2004; this revised and updated version is denoted \\nSWEBOK V3.

The software engi -\\nneering body of knowledge is constantly evolv -\\ning.

In so doing, \\nthe Society has been guided by the experience \\nof disciplines with longer histories but was not \\nbound either by their problems or their solutions.\\nIt should be noted that the Guide does not pur-\\nport to define the body of knowledge but rather to \\nserve as a compendium and guide to the body of \\nknowledge that has been developing and evolv -\\ning over the past four decades. Furthermore, \\nthis body of knowledge is not static. The Guide \\nmust, necessarily, develop and evolve as software \\nengineering matures. It nevertheless constitutes \\na valuable element of the software engineering \\ninfrastructure.\\nIn 1958, John Tukey, the world-renowned stat-\\nistician, coined the term software. The term soft-\\nware\\u2008engineering\\u2008was used in the title of a NATO \\nconference held in Germany in 1968. The IEEE \\nComputer Society first published its Transactions\\u2008\\non\\u2008Software\\u2008Engineering\\u2008in 1972. The committee \\nestablished within the IEEE Computer Society \\nfor developing software engineering standards \\nwas founded in 1976.\\nThe first holistic view of software engineer -\\ning to emerge from the IEEE Computer Society \\nresulted from an effort led by Fletcher Buckley \\nto develop IEEE standard 730 for software qual -\\nity assurance, which was completed in 1979. \\nThe purpose of IEEE Std. 730 was to provide \\nuniform, minimum acceptable requirements for \\npreparation and content of software quality assur-\\nance plans. This standard was influential in com-\\npleting the developing standards in the following \\ntopics: configuration management, software test-\\ning, software requirements, software design, and \\nsoftware verification and validation.\\nDuring the period 1981–1985, the IEEE Com -\\nputer Society held a series of workshops con -\\ncerning the application of software engineering \\nstandards. These workshops involved practitio -\\nners sharing their experiences with existing stan-\\ndards. The workshops also held sessions on plan-\\nning for future standards, including one involving \\nmeasures and metrics for software engineer -\\ning products and processes. The planning also \\nresulted in IEEE Std. 1002, Taxonomy\\u2008of\\u2008Software\\u2008\\nEngineering\\u2008Standards (1986), which provided a \\nnew, holistic view of software engineering. The \\nstandard describes the form and content of a soft-\\nware engineering standards taxonomy. It explains \\nthe various types of software engineering stan -\\ndards, their functional and external relationships, \\nand the role of various functions participating in \\nthe software life cycle.\\nIn 1990, planning for an international stan -\\ndard with an overall view was begun. The plan -\\nning focused on reconciling the software process \\nviews from IEEE Std. 1074 and the revised US \\nDoD standard 2167A. The revision was eventu -\\nally published as DoD Std. 498. The international \\nstandard was completed in 1995 with designa -\\ntion, ISO/IEC 12207, and given the title of Stan-\\ndard\\u2008for\\u2008Software\\u2008Life\\u2008Cycle\\u2008Processes. Std. ISO/\\nIEC 12207 provided a major point of departure \\nfor the body of knowledge captured in this book.\\nIt was the IEEE Computer Society Board of \\nGovernors’ approval of the motion put forward \\nin May 1993 by Fletcher Buckley which resulted \\nin the writing of this book. The Association for \\nComputing Machinery (ACM) Council approved \\na related motion in August 1993. The two motions \\nled to a joint committee under the leadership of \\nMario Barbacci and Stuart Zweben who served as \\ncochairs. The mission statement of the joint com-\\nmittee was “To establish the appropriate sets(s) \\nof criteria and norms for professional practice of \\nsoftware engineering upon which industrial deci-\\nsions, professional certification, and educational \\ncurricula can be based.” The steering committee \\norganized task forces in the following areas:\\n1. Define Required Body of Knowledge and \\nRecommended Practices.')),\n",

Define Ethics and Professional Standards.\\n3. Define Educational Curricula for undergradu-\\nate, graduate, and continuing education.\\nThis book supplies the first component: required \\nbody of knowledge and recommend practices.\\nThe code of ethics and professional practice \\nfor software engineering was completed in 1998 \\nand approved by both the ACM Council and the \\nIEEE Computer Society Board of Governors. It \\nhas been adopted by numerous corporations and \\nother organizations and is included in several \\nrecent textbooks.\\nThe educational curriculum for undergraduates \\nis being completed by a joint effort of the IEEE \\nComputer Society and the ACM and is expected \\nto be completed in 2004.\\nEvery profession is based on a body of knowl -\\nedge and recommended practices, although they \\nare not always defined in a precise manner. In \\nmany cases, these are formally documented, usu-\\nally in a form that permits them to be used for \\nsuch purposes as accreditation of academic pro -\\ngrams, development of education and training \\nprograms, certification of specialists, or profes -\\nsional licensing. Generally, a professional society \\nor related body maintains custody of such a for -\\nmal definition. In cases where no such formality \\nexists, the body of knowledge and recommended \\npractices are “generally recognized” by practitio-\\nners and may be codified in a variety of ways for \\ndifferent uses.\\nIt is hoped that readers will find this book use -\\nful in guiding them toward the knowledge and \\nresources they need in their lifelong career devel-\\nopment as software engineering professionals.\\nThe book is dedicated to Fletcher Buckley in \\nrecognition of his commitment to promoting soft-\\nware engineering as a professional discipline and \\nhis excellence as a software engineering practi -\\ntioner in radar applications.\\nLeonard L.

The goal in developing this update to \\nSWEBOK is to improve the currency, readability, \\nconsistency, and usability of the Guide.\\nAll knowledge areas (KAs) have been updated \\nto reflect changes in software engineering since \\npublication of SWEBOK 2004. Four new foun -\\ndation KAs and a Software Engineering Profes -\\nsional Practices KA have been added. The Soft -\\nware Engineering Tools and Methods KA has \\nbeen revised as Software Engineering Models \\nand Methods. Software engineering tools is now \\na topic in each of the KAs. Three appendices pro-\\nvide the specifications for the KA description, an \\nannotated set of relevant standards for each KA, \\nand a listing of the references cited in the Guide. \\nThis Guide, written under the auspices of the \\nProfessional Activities Board of the IEEE Com -\\nputer Society, represents a next step in the evolu-\\ntion of the software engineering profession.\\nWHAT IS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING?\\nISO/IEC/IEEE Systems and Software Engineering \\nVocabulary (SEVOCAB) defines software engi -\\nneering as “the application of a systematic, disci-\\nplined, quantifiable approach to the development, \\noperation, and maintenance of software; that is, the \\napplication of engineering to software).”1 \\nWHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES OF THE \\nSWEBOK GUIDE?\\nThe Guide should not be confused with the Body \\nof Knowledge itself, which exists in the published \\n1 See www.computer.org/sevocab.\\nliterature. The purpose of the Guide is to describe \\nthe portion of the Body of Knowledge that is gen-\\nerally accepted, to organize that portion, and to \\nprovide topical access to it. \\nThe Guide\\u2008to\\u2008the\\u2008Software\\u2008Engineering\\u2008Body\\u2008\\nof\\u2008Knowledge (SWEBOK Guide) was established \\nwith the following five objectives:\\n1. To promote a consistent view of software \\nengineering worldwide\\n2. To specify the scope of, and clarify the place \\nof software engineering with respect to other \\ndisciplines such as computer science, proj -\\nect management, computer engineering, and \\nmathematics\\n3. To characterize the contents of the software \\nengineering discipline\\n4. To provide a topical access to the Software \\nEngineering Body of Knowledge\\n5. To provide a foundation for curriculum \\ndevelopment and for individual certification \\nand licensing material\\nThe first of these objectives, a consistent world-\\nwide view of software engineering, was supported \\nby a development process which engaged approxi-\\nmately 150 reviewers from 33 countries. More \\ninformation regarding the development process can \\nbe found on the website ( www.swebok.org). Pro-\\nfessional and learned societies and public agencies \\ninvolved in software engineering were contacted, \\nmade aware of this project to update SWEBOK, and \\ninvited to participate in the review process. KA edi-\\ntors were recruited from North America, the Pacific \\nRim, and Europe. Presentations on the project were \\nmade at various international venues.\\nThe second of the objectives, the desire to \\nspecify the scope of software engineering, moti -\\nvates the fundamental organization of the Guide. \\nThe material that is recognized as being within \\nthis discipline is organized into the fifteen KAs \\nlisted in Table I.1. Each of these KAs is treated in \\na chapter in this Guide.')),\n",

To this end, SWEBOK V3 also rec-\\nognizes seven related disciplines, listed in Table \\nI.2. Software engineers should, of course, have \\nknowledge of material from these disciplines \\n(and the KA descriptions in this Guide may make \\nreference to them). It is not, however, an objec -\\ntive of the SWEBOK Guide  to characterize the \\nknowledge of the related disciplines. \\nTable I.2.

The \\ndetailed specifications provided by the project’s \\neditorial team to the associate editors regarding \\nthe contents of the KA descriptions can be found \\nin Appendix A.\\nThe Guide uses a hierarchical organization to \\ndecompose each KA into a set of topics with rec-\\nognizable labels. A two (sometime three) level \\nbreakdown provides a reasonable way to find \\ntopics of interest. The Guide treats the selected \\ntopics in a manner compatible with major schools \\nof thought and with breakdowns generally found \\nin industry and in software engineering literature \\nand standards. The breakdowns of topics do not \\npresume particular application domains, business \\nuses, management philosophies, development \\nmethods, and so forth. The extent of each topic’s \\ndescription is only that needed to understand the \\ngenerally accepted nature of the topics and for \\nthe reader to successfully find reference material; \\nthe Body of Knowledge is found in the reference \\nmaterials themselves, not in the Guide.\\nREFERENCE MATERIAL AND MATRIX\\nTo provide topical access to the knowledge—the \\nfourth of the project’s objectives—the Guide \\nidentifies authoritative reference material for \\neach KA. Appendix C provides a Consolidated \\nReference List for the Guide. Each KA includes \\nrelevant references from the Consolidated Refer-\\nence List and also includes a matrix relating the \\nreference material to the included topics. \\nIt should be noted that the Guide does not \\nattempt to be comprehensive in its citations. \\nMuch material that is both suitable and excellent \\nis not referenced.

More precisely, generally accepted \\nknowledge should be included in the study mate-\\nrial for the software engineering licensing exami-\\nnation that graduates would take after gaining \\nfour years of work experience.

For reasons of consistency, the \\nterm “engineering” will not be used in this KA \\nother than for software engineering per se. \\nFor the same reason, “requirements engineer,” \\na term which appears in some of the literature, \\nwill not be used either. Instead, the term “software \\nengineer” or, in some specific cases, “require -\\nments specialist” will be used, the latter where \\nthe role in question is usually performed by an \\nindividual other than a software engineer. This \\ndoes not imply, however, that a software engineer \\ncould not perform the function.\\nA risk inherent in the proposed breakdown is \\nthat a waterfall-like process may be inferred. To \\nguard against this, topic 2, Requirements Process, \\nis designed to provide a high-level overview of the \\nrequirements process by setting out the resources \\nand constraints under which the process operates \\nand which act to configure it. \\nAn alternate decomposition could use a prod -\\nuct-based structure (system requirements, soft -\\nware requirements, prototypes, use cases, and \\nso on). The process-based breakdown reflects \\nthe fact that the requirements process, if it is to \\nbe successful, must be considered as a process \\ninvolving complex, tightly coupled activities \\n(both sequential and concurrent), rather than as a \\ndiscrete, one-off activity performed at the outset \\nof a software development project.\\nThe Software Requirements KA is related \\nclosely to the Software Design, Software Testing, \\nSoftware Maintenance, Software Configuration \\nManagement, Software Engineering Manage -\\nment, Software Engineering Process, Software \\nEngineering Models and Methods, and Software \\nQuality KAs.\\nBREAKDOWN OF TOPICS FOR \\nSOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS \\nThe breakdown of topics for the Software \\nRequirements KA is shown in Figure 1.1.\\n1. Software Requirements Fundamentals\\n[1*, c4, c4s1, c10s1, c10s4] [2*, c1, c6, c12]\\n1.1.

It \\nmay aim to automate part of a task for someone \\nto support the business processes of an organiza -\\ntion, to correct shortcomings of existing software, \\nor to control a device—to name just a few of the \\nmany problems for which software solutions are \\npossible. The ways in which users, business pro -\\ncesses, and devices function are typically complex. \\nBy extension, therefore, the requirements on par-\\nticular software are typically a complex combina-\\ntion from various people at different levels of an \\norganization, and who are in one way or another \\ninvolved or connected with this feature from the \\nenvironment in which the software will operate. \\nAn essential property of all software require -\\nments is that they be verifiable as an individual \\nfeature as a functional requirement or at the \\nsystem level as a nonfunctional requirement. It \\nmay be difficult or costly to verify certain soft -\\nware requirements. For example, verification \\nof the throughput requirement on a call center \\nmay necessitate the development of simulation \\nsoftware. Software requirements, software test -\\ning, and quality personnel must ensure that the \\nrequirements can be verified within available \\nresource constraints. \\nRequirements have other attributes in addi -\\ntion to behavioral properties. Common examples \\ninclude a priority rating to enable tradeoffs in \\nthe face of finite resources and a status value to \\nenable project progress to be monitored. Typi -\\ncally, software requirements are uniquely identi -\\nfied so that they can be subjected to software con-\\nfiguration management over the entire life cycle \\nof the feature and of the software. \\n1.2. Product\\u2008and\\u2008Process\\u2008Requirements\\nA product requirement is a need or constraint on \\nthe software to be developed (for example, “The \\nsoftware shall verify that a student meets all pre -\\nrequisites before he or she registers for a course”).\\nA process requirement is essentially a con -\\nstraint on the development of the software (for \\nexample, “The software shall be developed using \\na RUP process”).\\nSome software requirements generate implicit \\nprocess requirements. The choice of verification \\nFigure 1.1. Breakdown of Topics for the Software Requirements KA')),\n",

Another might be the \\nuse of particularly rigorous analysis techniques \\n(such as formal specification methods) to reduce \\nfaults that can lead to inadequate reliability. Pro -\\ncess requirements may also be imposed directly \\nby the development organization, their customer, \\nor a third party such as a safety regulator. \\n1.3. Functional\\u2008and\\u2008Nonfunctional\\u2008Requirements\\nFunctional requirements describe the functions \\nthat the software is to execute; for example, for -\\nmatting some text or modulating a signal. They \\nare sometimes known as capabilities or features. \\nA functional requirement can also be described \\nas one for which a finite set of test steps can be \\nwritten to validate its behavior.\\nNonfunctional requirements are the ones that \\nact to constrain the solution. Nonfunctional \\nrequirements are sometimes known as constraints \\nor quality requirements. They can be further clas-\\nsified according to whether they are performance \\nrequirements, maintainability requirements, \\nsafety requirements, reliability requirements, \\nsecurity requirements, interoperability require -\\nments or one of many other types of software \\nrequirements (see Models and Quality Character-\\nistics in the Software Quality KA).\\n1.4. Emergent\\u2008Properties\\nSome requirements represent emergent proper -\\nties of software—that is, requirements that can -\\nnot be addressed by a single component but that \\ndepend on how all the software components \\ninteroperate. The throughput requirement for a \\ncall center would, for example, depend on how \\nthe telephone system, information system, and \\nthe operators all interacted under actual operat -\\ning conditions. Emergent properties are crucially \\ndependent on the system architecture. \\n1.5. Quantifiable\\u2008Requirements\\nSoftware requirements should be stated as clearly \\nand as unambiguously as possible, and, where \\nappropriate, quantitatively. It is important to \\navoid vague and unverifiable requirements that \\ndepend for their interpretation on subjective \\njudgment (“the software shall be reliable”; “the \\nsoftware shall be user-friendly”). This is par -\\nticularly important for nonfunctional require -\\nments. Two examples of quantified requirements \\nare the following: a call center’s software must \\nincrease the center’s throughput by 20%; and a \\nsystem shall have a probability of generating a \\nfatal error during any hour of operation of less \\nthan 1 * 10−8. The throughput requirement is at a \\nvery high level and will need to be used to derive \\na number of detailed requirements. The reliabil -\\nity requirement will tightly constrain the system \\narchitecture. \\n1.6. System\\u2008Requirements\\u2008and\\u2008Software\\u2008\\nRequirements\\nIn this topic, “system” means \\nan interacting combination of elements \\nto accomplish a defined objective. These \\ninclude hardware, software, firmware, \\npeople, information, techniques, facilities, \\nservices, and other support elements, \\nas defined by the International Council on Soft -\\nware and Systems Engineering (INCOSE) [3].\\nSystem requirements are the requirements for \\nthe system as a whole. In a system containing \\nsoftware components, software requirements are \\nderived from system requirements.\\nThis KA defines “user requirements” in a \\nrestricted way, as the requirements of the sys -\\ntem’s customers or end users. System require -\\nments, by contrast, encompass user requirements, \\nrequirements of other stakeholders (such as regu-\\nlatory authorities), and requirements without an \\nidentifiable human source. \\n2. Requirements Process \\n[1*, c4s4] [2*, c1–4, c6, c22, c23]\\nThis section introduces the software requirements \\nprocess, orienting the remaining five topics and \\nshowing how the requirements process dovetails \\nwith the overall software engineering process.')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='1-4 SWEBOK® Guide V3.0\\n2.1. Process\\u2008Models\\nThe objective of this topic is to provide an under-\\nstanding that the requirements process\\n• is not a discrete front-end activity of the soft-\\nware life cycle, but rather a process initiated \\nat the beginning of a project that continues to \\nbe refined throughout the life cycle;\\n• identifies software requirements as configu -\\nration items and manages them using the \\nsame software configuration management \\npractices as other products of the software \\nlife cycle processes;\\n• needs to be adapted to the organization and \\nproject context.\\nIn particular, the topic is concerned with how \\nthe activities of elicitation, analysis, specifica -\\ntion, and validation are configured for different \\ntypes of projects and constraints. The topic also \\nincludes activities that provide input into the \\nrequirements process, such as marketing and fea-\\nsibility studies. \\n2.2. Process\\u2008Actors\\nThis topic introduces the roles of the people who \\nparticipate in the requirements process. This pro-\\ncess is fundamentally interdisciplinary, and the \\nrequirements specialist needs to mediate between \\nthe domain of the stakeholder and that of soft -\\nware engineering. There are often many people \\ninvolved besides the requirements specialist, each \\nof whom has a stake in the software. The stake -\\nholders will vary across projects, but will always \\ninclude users/operators and customers (who need \\nnot be the same). \\nTypical examples of software stakeholders \\ninclude (but are not restricted to) the following:\\n• Users: This group comprises those who will \\noperate the software. It is often a heteroge -\\nneous group involving people with different \\nroles and requirements.\\n• Customers: This group comprises those who \\nhave commissioned the software or who rep-\\nresent the software’s target market.\\n• Market analysts: A mass-market product \\nwill not have a commissioning customer, so \\nmarketing people are often needed to estab -\\nlish what the market needs and to act as \\nproxy customers.\\n• Regulators: Many application domains, such \\nas banking and public transport, are regu -\\nlated. Software in these domains must com -\\nply with the requirements of the regulatory \\nauthorities.\\n• Software engineers: These individuals have \\na legitimate interest in profiting from devel -\\noping the software by, for example, reusing \\ncomponents in or from other products. If, \\nin this scenario, a customer of a particu -\\nlar product has specific requirements that \\ncompromise the potential for component \\nreuse, the software engineers must carefully \\nweigh their own stake against those of the \\ncustomer. Specific requirements, particu -\\nlarly constraints, may have major impact on \\nproject cost or delivery because they either \\nfit well or poorly with the skill set of the \\nengineers. Important tradeoffs among such \\nrequirements should be identified.\\nIt will not be possible to perfectly satisfy the \\nrequirements of every stakeholder, and it is the \\nsoftware engineer’s job to negotiate tradeoffs that \\nare both acceptable to the principal stakeholders \\nand within budgetary, technical, regulatory, and \\nother constraints. A prerequisite for this is that all \\nthe stakeholders be identified, the nature of their \\n“stake” analyzed, and their requirements elicited. \\n2.3. Process\\u2008Support\\u2008and\\u2008Management\\nThis section introduces the project management \\nresources required and consumed by the require -\\nments process. It establishes the context for the \\nfirst topic (Initiation and Scope Definition) of the \\nSoftware Engineering Management KA. Its prin-\\ncipal purpose is to make the link between the pro-\\ncess activities identified in 2.1 and the issues of \\ncost, human resources, training, and tools. \\n2.4. Process\\u2008Quality\\u2008and\\u2008Improvement\\nThis topic is concerned with the assessment of \\nthe quality and improvement of the requirements \\nprocess. Its purpose is to emphasize the key role \\nthe requirements process plays in terms of the ')),\n",

It will help to \\norient the requirements process with quality stan-\\ndards and process improvement models for soft -\\nware and systems. Process quality and improve -\\nment is closely related to both the Software \\nQuality KA and Software Engineering Process \\nKA, comprising\\n• requirements process coverage by process \\nimprovement standards and models;\\n• requirements process measures and \\nbenchmarking;\\n• improvement planning and implementation;\\n• security/CIA improvement/planning and \\nimplementation. \\n3. Requirements Elicitation\\n[1*, c4s5] [2*, c5, c6, c9]\\nRequirements elicitation is concerned with the \\norigins of software requirements and how the \\nsoftware engineer can collect them. It is the first \\nstage in building an understanding of the problem \\nthe software is required to solve. It is fundamen -\\ntally a human activity and is where the stakehold-\\ners are identified and relationships established \\nbetween the development team and the customer. \\nIt is variously termed “requirements capture,” \\n“requirements discovery,” and “requirements \\nacquisition.”\\nOne of the fundamental principles of a good \\nrequirements elicitation process is that of effec -\\ntive communication between the various stake -\\nholders. This communication continues through \\nthe entire Software Development Life Cycle \\n(SDLC) process with different stakeholders at \\ndifferent points in time. Before development \\nbegins, requirements specialists may form the \\nconduit for this communication. They must medi-\\nate between the domain of the software users (and \\nother stakeholders) and the technical world of the \\nsoftware engineer. A set of internally consistent \\nmodels at different levels of abstraction facilitate \\ncommunications between software users/stake -\\nholders and software engineers.\\nA critical element of requirements elicitation is \\ninforming the project scope. This involves provid-\\ning a description of the software being specified \\nand its purpose and prioritizing the deliverables \\nto ensure the customer’s most important business \\nneeds are satisfied first. This minimizes the risk \\nof requirements specialists spending time elicit -\\ning requirements that are of low importance, or \\nthose that turn out to be no longer relevant when \\nthe software is delivered. On the other hand, the \\ndescription must be scalable and extensible to \\naccept further requirements not expressed in the \\nfirst formal lists and compatible with the previous \\nones as contemplated in recursive methods.\\n3.1. Requirements\\u2008Sources\\nRequirements have many sources in typical soft -\\nware, and it is essential that all potential sources \\nbe identified and evaluated. This topic is designed \\nto promote awareness of the various sources of \\nsoftware requirements and of the frameworks for \\nmanaging them. The main points covered are as \\nfollows:\\n• Goals. The term “goal” (sometimes called \\n“business concern” or “critical success fac -\\ntor”) refers to the overall, high-level objec -\\ntives of the software. Goals provide the moti-\\nvation for the software but are often vaguely \\nformulated. Software engineers need to pay \\nparticular attention to assessing the value \\n(relative to priority) and cost of goals. A fea-\\nsibility study is a relatively low-cost way of \\ndoing this. \\n• Domain knowledge. The software engineer \\nneeds to acquire or have available knowl -\\nedge about the application domain. Domain \\nknowledge provides the background against \\nwhich all elicited requirements knowledge \\nmust be set in order to understand it. It’s \\na good practice to emulate an ontological \\napproach in the knowledge domain. Rela -\\ntions between relevant concepts within the \\napplication domain should be identified.\\n• Stakeholders (see section 2.2, Process \\nActors). Much software has proved unsat -\\nisfactory because it has stressed the require -\\nments of one group of stakeholders at the \\nexpense of others. Hence, the delivered \\nsoftware is difficult to use, or subverts the \\ncultural or political structures of the cus -\\ntomer organization. The software engineer \\nneeds to identify, represent, and manage ')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='1-6 SWEBOK® Guide V3.0\\nthe “viewpoints” of many different types of \\nstakeholders.\\n• Business rules. These are statements that \\ndefine or constrain some aspect of the struc -\\nture or the behavior of the business itself. “A \\nstudent cannot register in next semester’s \\ncourses if there remain some unpaid tuition \\nfees” would be an example of a business rule \\nthat would be a requirement source for a uni-\\nversity’s course-registration software.\\n• The operational environment. Requirements \\nwill be derived from the environment in \\nwhich the software will be executed. These \\nmay be, for example, timing constraints \\nin real-time software or performance con -\\nstraints in a business environment. These \\nmust be sought out actively because they can \\ngreatly affect software feasibility and cost as \\nwell as restrict design choices. \\n• The organizational environment. Software \\nis often required to support a business pro -\\ncess, the selection of which may be condi -\\ntioned by the structure, culture, and internal \\npolitics of the organization. The software \\nengineer needs to be sensitive to these since, \\nin general, new software should not force \\nunplanned change on the business process.\\n3.2. Elicitation\\u2008Techniques\\nOnce the requirements sources have been iden -\\ntified, the software engineer can start eliciting \\nrequirements information from them. Note that \\nrequirements are seldom elicited ready-made. \\nRather, the software engineer elicits information \\nfrom which he or she formulates requirements. \\nThis topic concentrates on techniques for getting \\nhuman stakeholders to articulate requirements-\\nrelevant information. It is a very difficult task and \\nthe software engineer needs to be sensitized to the \\nfact that (for example) users may have difficulty \\ndescribing their tasks, may leave important infor-\\nmation unstated, or may be unwilling or unable to \\ncooperate. It is particularly important to understand \\nthat elicitation is not a passive activity and that, \\neven if cooperative and articulate stakeholders are \\navailable, the software engineer has to work hard \\nto elicit the right information. Many business or \\ntechnical requirements are tacit or in feedback that \\nhas yet to be obtained from end users. The impor-\\ntance of planning, verification, and validation in \\nrequirements elicitation cannot be overstated. A \\nnumber of techniques exist for requirements elici-\\ntation; the principal ones are these: \\n• Interviews. Interviewing stakeholders is a \\n“traditional” means of eliciting requirements. \\nIt is important to understand the advantages \\nand limitations of interviews and how they \\nshould be conducted.\\n• Scenarios. Scenarios provide a valuable \\nmeans for providing context to the elicita -\\ntion of user requirements. They allow the \\nsoftware engineer to provide a framework \\nfor questions about user tasks by permitting \\n“what if” and “how is this done” questions \\nto be asked. The most common type of sce -\\nnario is the use case description. There is a \\nlink here to topic 4.2 (Conceptual Modeling) \\nbecause scenario notations such as use case \\ndiagrams are common in modeling software.\\n• Prototypes. This technique is a valuable tool \\nfor clarifying ambiguous requirements. They \\ncan act in a similar way to scenarios by pro -\\nviding users with a context within which they \\ncan better understand what information they \\nneed to provide. There is a wide range of \\nprototyping techniques—from paper mock -\\nups of screen designs to beta-test versions of \\nsoftware products—and a strong overlap of \\ntheir separate uses for requirements elicita -\\ntion and for requirements validation (see \\nsection 6.2, Prototyping). Low fidelity proto-\\ntypes are often preferred to avoid stakeholder \\n“anchoring” on minor, incidental character -\\nistics of a higher quality prototype that can \\nlimit design flexibility in unintended ways.\\n• Facilitated meetings. The purpose of these \\nmeetings is to try to achieve a summative \\neffect, whereby a group of people can bring \\nmore insight into their software require -\\nments than by working individually. They \\ncan brainstorm and refine ideas that may be \\ndifficult to bring to the surface using inter -\\nviews. Another advantage is that conflicting \\nrequirements surface early on in a way that \\nlets the stakeholders recognize where these \\noccur. When it works well, this technique ')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='Software Requirements 1-7\\nmay result in a richer and more consistent \\nset of requirements than might otherwise \\nbe achievable. However, meetings need to \\nbe handled carefully (hence the need for a \\nfacilitator) to prevent a situation in which \\nthe critical abilities of the team are eroded \\nby group loyalty, or in which requirements \\nreflecting the concerns of a few outspoken \\n(and perhaps senior) people that are favored \\nto the detriment of others.\\n• Observation. The importance of software \\ncontext within the organizational environ -\\nment has led to the adaptation of observa -\\ntional techniques such as ethnography for \\nrequirements elicitation. Software engineers \\nlearn about user tasks by immersing them -\\nselves in the environment and observing how \\nusers perform their tasks by interacting with \\neach other and with software tools and other \\nresources. These techniques are relatively \\nexpensive but also instructive because they \\nillustrate that many user tasks and business \\nprocesses are too subtle and complex for \\ntheir actors to describe easily.\\n• User stories. This technique is commonly \\nused in adaptive methods (see Agile Meth -\\nods in the Software Engineering Models \\nand Methods KA) and refers to short, high-\\nlevel descriptions of required functionality \\nexpressed in customer terms. A typical user \\nstory has the form: “As\\u2008a\\u2008<role>,\\u2008I\\u2008want\\u2008\\n<goal/desire>\\u2008so\\u2008that\\u2008<benefit>.” A user \\nstory is intended to contain just enough infor-\\nmation so that the developers can produce a \\nreasonable estimate of the effort to imple -\\nment it. The aim is to avoid some of the waste \\nthat often happens in projects where detailed \\nrequirements are gathered early but become \\ninvalid before the work begins. Before a user \\nstory is implemented, an appropriate accep -\\ntance procedure must be written by the cus -\\ntomer to determine whether the goals of the \\nuser story have been fulfilled.\\n• Other techniques. A range of other techniques \\nfor supporting the elicitation of requirements \\ninformation exist and range from analyzing \\ncompetitors’ products to applying data min -\\ning techniques to using sources of domain \\nknowledge or customer request databases.\\n4. Requirements Analysis\\n[1*, c4s1, c4s5, c10s4, c12s5] \\n[2*, c7, c11, c12, c17]\\nThis topic is concerned with the process of ana -\\nlyzing requirements to\\n• detect and resolve conflicts between \\nrequirements;\\n• discover the bounds of the software and how \\nit must interact with its organizational and \\noperational environment;\\n• elaborate system requirements to derive soft-\\nware requirements.\\nThe traditional view of requirements analysis \\nhas been that it be reduced to conceptual model -\\ning using one of a number of analysis methods, \\nsuch as the structured analysis method. While \\nconceptual modeling is important, we include the \\nclassification of requirements to help inform trad-\\neoffs between requirements (requirements clas -\\nsification) and the process of establishing these \\ntradeoffs (requirements negotiation). \\nCare must be taken to describe requirements \\nprecisely enough to enable the requirements to \\nbe validated, their implementation to be verified, \\nand their costs to be estimated. \\n4.1. Requirements\\u2008Classification\\nRequirements can be classified on a number of \\ndimensions. Examples include the following:\\n• Whether the requirement is functional or \\nnonfunctional (see section 1.3, Functional \\nand Nonfunctional Requirements).\\n• Whether the requirement is derived from one \\nor more high-level requirements or an emer-\\ngent property (see section 1.4, Emergent \\nProperties), or is being imposed directly on \\nthe software by a stakeholder or some other \\nsource.\\n• Whether the requirement is on the product \\nor the process (see section 1.2, Product and \\nProcess Requirements). Requirements on the \\nprocess can constrain the choice of contrac -\\ntor, the software engineering process to be \\nadopted, or the standards to be adhered to. ')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='1-8 SWEBOK® Guide V3.0\\n• The requirement priority. The higher the pri-\\nority, the more essential the requirement is \\nfor meeting the overall goals of the software. \\nOften classified on a fixed-point scale such \\nas mandatory, highly desirable, desirable, \\nor optional, the priority often has to be bal -\\nanced against the cost of development and \\nimplementation. \\n• The scope of the requirement. Scope refers \\nto the extent to which a requirement affects \\nthe software and software components. \\nSome requirements, particularly certain \\nnonfunctional ones, have a global scope in \\nthat their satisfaction cannot be allocated to \\na discrete component. Hence, a requirement \\nwith global scope may strongly affect the \\nsoftware architecture and the design of many \\ncomponents, whereas one with a narrow \\nscope may offer a number of design choices \\nand have little impact on the satisfaction of \\nother requirements.\\n• Volatility/stability. Some requirements will \\nchange during the life cycle of the soft -\\nware—and even during the development \\nprocess itself. It is useful if some estimate \\nof the likelihood that a requirement will \\nchange can be made. For example, in a bank-\\ning application, requirements for functions \\nto calculate and credit interest to customers’ \\naccounts are likely to be more stable than a \\nrequirement to support a particular kind of \\ntax-free account. The former reflects a fun -\\ndamental feature of the banking domain (that \\naccounts can earn interest), while the latter \\nmay be rendered obsolete by a change to \\ngovernment legislation. Flagging potentially \\nvolatile requirements can help the software \\nengineer establish a design that is more toler-\\nant of change.\\nOther classifications may be appropriate, \\ndepending upon the organization’s normal prac -\\ntice and the application itself. \\nThere is a strong overlap between requirements \\nclassification and requirements attributes (see \\nsection 7.3, Requirements Attributes).\\n4.2. Conceptual\\u2008Modeling\\u2008\\nThe development of models of a real-world \\nproblem is key to software requirements analy -\\nsis. Their purpose is to aid in understanding the \\nsituation in which the problem occurs, as well as \\ndepicting a solution. Hence, conceptual models \\ncomprise models of entities from the problem \\ndomain, configured to reflect their real-world \\nrelationships and dependencies. This topic is \\nclosely related to the Software Engineering Mod-\\nels and Methods KA.\\nSeveral kinds of models can be developed. \\nThese include use case diagrams, data flow mod-\\nels, state models, goal-based models, user inter -\\nactions, object models, data models, and many \\nothers. Many of these modeling notations are part \\nof the\\u2008Unified\\u2008Modeling\\u2008Language\\u2008(UML).\\u2008Use \\ncase diagrams, for example, are routinely used \\nto depict scenarios where the boundary separates \\nthe actors (users or systems in the external envi -\\nronment) from the internal behavior where each \\nuse case depicts a functionality of the system.\\nThe factors that influence the choice of model-\\ning notation include these:\\n• The nature of the problem. Some types of \\nsoftware demand that certain aspects be ana-\\nlyzed particularly rigorously. For example, \\nstate and parametric models, which are part \\nof SysML [4], are likely to be more impor -\\ntant for real-time software than for informa -\\ntion systems, while it would usually be the \\nopposite for object and activity models.\\n• The expertise of the software engineer. It is \\noften more productive to adopt a modeling \\nnotation or method with which the software \\nengineer has experience. \\n• The process requirements of the customer \\n(see section 1.2, Product and Process \\nRequirements). Customers may impose their \\nfavored notation or method or prohibit any \\nwith which they are unfamiliar. This factor \\ncan conflict with the previous factor.\\nNote that, in almost all cases, it is useful to start \\nby building a model of the software context. The \\nsoftware context provides a connection between \\nthe intended software and its external environment. ')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='Software Requirements 1-9\\nThis is crucial to understanding the software’s con-\\ntext in its operational environment and to identify-\\ning its interfaces with the environment.\\nThis subtopic does not seek to “teach” a particu-\\nlar modeling style or notation but rather provides \\nguidance on the purpose and intent of modeling.\\n4.3. Architectural\\u2008Design\\u2008and\\u2008Requirements\\u2008\\nAllocation\\nAt some point, the solution architecture must \\nbe derived. Architectural design is the point at \\nwhich the requirements process overlaps with \\nsoftware or systems design and illustrates how \\nimpossible it is to cleanly decouple the two tasks. \\nThis topic is closely related to Software Structure \\nand Architecture in the Software Design KA. In \\nmany cases, the software engineer acts as soft -\\nware architect because the process of analyzing \\nand elaborating the requirements demands that \\nthe architecture/design components that will be \\nresponsible for satisfying the requirements be \\nidentified. This is requirements allocation–the \\nassignment to architecture components respon -\\nsible for satisfying the requirements. \\nAllocation is important to permit detailed anal-\\nysis of requirements. Hence, for example, once a \\nset of requirements has been allocated to a com -\\nponent, the individual requirements can be further \\nanalyzed to discover further requirements on how \\nthe component needs to interact with other com -\\nponents in order to satisfy the allocated require -\\nments. In large projects, allocation stimulates a \\nnew round of analysis for each subsystem. As an \\nexample, requirements for a particular braking \\nperformance for a car (braking distance, safety in \\npoor driving conditions, smoothness of applica -\\ntion, pedal pressure required, and so on) may be \\nallocated to the braking hardware (mechanical \\nand hydraulic assemblies) and an antilock braking \\nsystem (ABS). Only when a requirement for an \\nantilock braking system has been identified, and \\nthe requirements allocated to it, can the capabili -\\nties of the ABS, the braking hardware, and emer-\\ngent properties (such as car weight) be used to \\nidentify the detailed ABS software requirements. \\nArchitectural design is closely identified with \\nconceptual modeling (see section 4.2, Conceptual \\nModeling). \\n4.4. Requirements\\u2008Negotiation\\nAnother term commonly used for this subtopic \\nis “conflict resolution.” This concerns resolv -\\ning problems with requirements where conflicts \\noccur between two stakeholders requiring mutu -\\nally incompatible features, between requirements \\nand resources, or between functional and non -\\nfunctional requirements, for example. In most \\ncases, it is unwise for the software engineer to \\nmake a unilateral decision, so it becomes neces -\\nsary to consult with the stakeholder(s) to reach a \\nconsensus on an appropriate tradeoff. It is often \\nimportant, for contractual reasons, that such deci-\\nsions be traceable back to the customer. We have \\nclassified this as a software requirements analy -\\nsis topic because problems emerge as the result \\nof analysis. However, a strong case can also be \\nmade for considering it a requirements validation \\ntopic (see topic 6, Requirements Validation).\\nRequirements prioritization is necessary, not \\nonly as a means to filter important requirements, \\nbut also in order to resolve conflicts and plan for \\nstaged deliveries, which means making complex \\ndecisions that require detailed domain knowledge \\nand good estimation skills. However, it is often \\ndifficult to get real information that can act as \\na basis for such decisions. In addition, require -\\nments often depend on each other, and priori -\\nties are relative. In practice, software engineers \\nperform requirements prioritization frequently \\nwithout knowing about all the requirements. \\nRequirements prioritization may follow a cost-\\nvalue approach that involves an analysis from \\nthe stakeholders defining in a scale the benefits \\nor the aggregated value that the implementa -\\ntion of the requirement brings them, versus the \\npenalties of not having implemented a particular \\nrequirement. It also involves an analysis from \\nthe software engineers estimating in a scale the \\ncost of implementing each requirement, relative \\nto other requirements. Another requirements pri -\\noritization approach called the analytic hierarchy \\nprocess involves comparing all unique pairs of \\nrequirements to determine which of the two is of \\nhigher priority, and to what extent.')),\n",

Formal\\u2008Analysis\\nFormal analysis concerns not only topic 4, but \\nalso sections 5.3 and 6.3. This topic is also related \\nto Formal Methods in the Software Engineering \\nModels and Methods Knowledge Area.\\nFormal analysis has made an impact on some \\napplication domains, particularly those of high-\\nintegrity systems. The formal expression of \\nrequirements requires a language with formally \\ndefined semantics. The use of a formal analysis \\nfor requirements expression has two benefits. \\nFirst, it enables requirements expressed in the \\nlanguage to be specified precisely and unambigu-\\nously, thus (in principle) avoiding the potential \\nfor misinterpretation. Secondly, requirements can \\nbe reasoned over, permitting desired properties \\nof the specified software to be proven. Formal \\nreasoning requires tool support to be practicable \\nfor anything other than trivial systems, and tools \\ngenerally fall into two types: theorem provers or \\nmodel checkers. In neither case can proof be fully \\nautomated, and the level of competence in formal \\nreasoning needed in order to use the tools restricts \\nthe wider application of formal analysis.\\nMost formal analysis is focused on relatively \\nlate stages of requirements analysis. It is gener -\\nally counterproductive to apply formalization \\nuntil the business goals and user requirements \\nhave come into sharp focus through means such \\nas those described elsewhere in section 4. How -\\never, once the requirements have stabilized and \\nhave been elaborated to specify concrete proper -\\nties of the software, it may be beneficial to for -\\nmalize at least the critical requirements. This per-\\nmits static validation that the software specified \\nby the requirements does indeed have the proper-\\nties (for example, absence of deadlock) that the \\ncustomer, users, and software engineer expect it \\nto have. \\n5. Requirements Specification\\n[1*, c4s2, c4s3, c12s2–5] [2*, c10]\\nFor most engineering professions, the term “spec-\\nification” refers to the assignment of numerical \\nvalues or limits to a product’s design goals. In \\nsoftware engineering, “software requirements \\nspecification” typically refers to the production of \\na document that can be systematically reviewed, \\nevaluated, and approved. For complex systems, \\nparticularly those involving substantial nonsoft -\\nware components, as many as three different \\ntypes of documents are produced: system defini -\\ntion, system requirements, and software require -\\nments. For simple software products, only the \\nthird of these is required. All three documents are \\ndescribed here, with the understanding that they \\nmay be combined as appropriate. A description of \\nsystems engineering can be found in the Related \\nDisciplines of Software Engineering chapter of \\nthis Guide. \\n5.1. System\\u2008Definition\\u2008Document\\nThis document (sometimes known as the user \\nrequirements document or concept of operations \\ndocument) records the system requirements. It \\ndefines the high-level system requirements from \\nthe domain perspective. Its readership includes \\nrepresentatives of the system users/customers \\n(marketing may play these roles for market-\\ndriven software), so its content must be couched \\nin terms of the domain. The document lists the \\nsystem requirements along with background \\ninformation about the overall objectives for the \\nsystem, its target environment, and a statement of \\nthe constraints, assumptions, and nonfunctional \\nrequirements. It may include conceptual models \\ndesigned to illustrate the system context, usage \\nscenarios, and the principal domain entities, as \\nwell as workflows. \\n5.2. System\\u2008Requirements\\u2008Specification\\nDevelopers of systems with substantial software \\nand nonsoftware components—a modern air -\\nliner, for example—often separate the descrip -\\ntion of system requirements from the description \\nof software requirements. In this view, system \\nrequirements are specified, the software require -\\nments are derived from the system requirements, \\nand then the requirements for the software com -\\nponents are specified. Strictly speaking, system \\nrequirements specification is a systems engineer-\\ning activity and falls outside the scope of this \\nGuide. ')),\n",

Software\\u2008Requirements\\u2008Specification\\nSoftware requirements specification  establishes \\nthe basis for agreement between customers and \\ncontractors or suppliers (in market-driven proj -\\nects, these roles may be played by the marketing \\nand development divisions) on what the software \\nproduct is to do as well as what it is not expected \\nto do. \\nSoftware requirements specification permits \\na rigorous assessment of requirements before \\ndesign can begin and reduces later redesign. It \\nshould also provide a realistic basis for estimat -\\ning product costs, risks, and schedules.\\nOrganizations can also use a software require -\\nments specification document as the basis for \\ndeveloping effective verification and validation \\nplans.\\nSoftware requirements specification provides \\nan informed basis for transferring a software prod-\\nuct to new users or software platforms. Finally, it \\ncan provide a basis for software enhancement.\\nSoftware requirements are often written in \\nnatural language, but, in software requirements \\nspecification, this may be supplemented by for -\\nmal or semiformal descriptions. Selection of \\nappropriate notations permits particular require -\\nments and aspects of the software architecture to \\nbe described more precisely and concisely than \\nnatural language. The general rule is that nota -\\ntions should be used that allow the requirements \\nto be described as precisely as possible. This is \\nparticularly crucial for safety-critical, regulatory, \\nand certain other types of dependable software. \\nHowever, the choice of notation is often con -\\nstrained by the training, skills, and preferences of \\nthe document’s authors and readers. \\nA number of quality indicators have been \\ndeveloped that can be used to relate the quality \\nof software requirements specification to other \\nproject variables such as cost, acceptance, per -\\nformance, schedule, and reproducibility. Quality \\nindicators for individual software requirements \\nspecification statements include imperatives, \\ndirectives, weak phrases, options, and continu -\\nances. Indicators for the entire software require -\\nments specification document include size, read -\\nability, specification, depth, and text structure. \\n6. Requirements Validation\\n[1*, c4s6] [2*, c13, c15]\\nThe requirements documents may be subject to val-\\nidation and verification procedures. The require -\\nments may be validated to ensure that the software \\nengineer has understood the requirements; it is \\nalso important to verify that a requirements docu-\\nment conforms to company standards and that it \\nis understandable, consistent, and complete. In \\ncases where documented company standards or \\nterminology are inconsistent with widely accepted \\nstandards, a mapping between the two should be \\nagreed on and appended to the document.\\nFormal notations offer the important advantage \\nof permitting the last two properties to be proven \\n(in a restricted sense, at least). Different stake -\\nholders, including representatives of the customer \\nand developer, should review the document(s). \\nRequirements documents are subject to the same \\nconfiguration management practices as the other \\ndeliverables of the software life cycle processes. \\nWhen practical, the individual requirements are \\nalso subject to configuration management, gener-\\nally using a requirements management tool (see \\ntopic 8, Software Requirements Tools).\\nIt is normal to explicitly schedule one or more \\npoints in the requirements process where the \\nrequirements are validated. The aim is to pick up \\nany problems before resources are committed to \\naddressing the requirements. Requirements vali -\\ndation is concerned with the process of examin -\\ning the requirements document to ensure that it \\ndefines the right software (that is, the software \\nthat the users expect). \\n6.1. Requirements\\u2008Reviews\\nPerhaps the most common means of validation \\nis by inspection or reviews of the requirements \\ndocument(s). A group of reviewers is assigned \\na brief to look for errors, mistaken assumptions, \\nlack of clarity, and deviation from standard prac-\\ntice. The composition of the group that conducts \\nthe review is important (at least one represen -\\ntative of the customer should be included for a \\ncustomer-driven project, for example), and it may \\nhelp to provide guidance on what to look for in \\nthe form of checklists.')),\n",

Prototyping\\nPrototyping is commonly a means for validating \\nthe software engineer’s interpretation of the soft-\\nware requirements, as well as for eliciting new \\nrequirements. As with elicitation, there is a range \\nof prototyping techniques and a number of points \\nin the process where prototype validation may \\nbe appropriate. The advantage of prototypes is \\nthat they can make it easier to interpret the soft -\\nware engineer’s assumptions and, where needed, \\ngive useful feedback on why they are wrong. For \\nexample, the dynamic behavior of a user inter -\\nface can be better understood through an ani -\\nmated prototype than through textual description \\nor graphical models. The volatility of a require -\\nment that is defined after prototyping has been \\ndone is extremely low because there is agreement \\nbetween the stakeholder and the software engi -\\nneer—therefore, for safety-critical and crucial \\nfeatures prototyping would really help. There are \\nalso disadvantages, however. These include the \\ndanger of users’ attention being distracted from \\nthe core underlying functionality by cosmetic \\nissues or quality problems with the prototype. For \\nthis reason, some advocate prototypes that avoid \\nsoftware, such as flip-chart-based mockups. Pro -\\ntotypes may be costly to develop. However, if \\nthey avoid the wastage of resources caused by \\ntrying to satisfy erroneous requirements, their \\ncost can be more easily justified. Early proto -\\ntypes may contain aspects of the final solution. \\nPrototypes may be evolutionary as opposed to \\nthrowaway.\\n6.3. Model\\u2008Validation\\nIt is typically necessary to validate the quality of \\nthe models developed during analysis. For exam-\\nple, in object models, it is useful to perform a \\nstatic analysis to verify that communication paths \\nexist between objects that, in the stakeholders’ \\ndomain, exchange data. If formal analysis nota -\\ntions are used, it is possible to use formal reason-\\ning to prove specification properties. This topic is \\nclosely related to the Software Engineering Mod-\\nels and Methods KA. \\n6.4. Acceptance\\u2008Tests\\nAn essential property of a software requirement \\nis that it should be possible to validate that the \\nfinished product satisfies it. Requirements that \\ncannot be validated are really just “wishes.” An \\nimportant task is therefore planning how to ver -\\nify each requirement. In most cases, designing \\nacceptance tests does this for how end-users typi-\\ncally conduct business using the system. \\nIdentifying and designing acceptance tests \\nmay be difficult for nonfunctional requirements \\n(see section 1.3,  Functional and Nonfunctional \\nRequirements). To be validated, they must first \\nbe analyzed and decomposed to the point where \\nthey can be expressed quantitatively.\\nAdditional information can be found in Accep-\\ntance/Qualification/Conformance Testing in the \\nSoftware Testing KA.\\n7. Practical Considerations\\n[1*, c4s1, c4s4, c4s6, c4s7]  \\n[2*, c3, c12, c14, c16, c18–21]\\nThe first level of topic decomposition pre -\\nsented in this KA may seem to describe a linear \\nsequence of activities. This is a simplified view \\nof the process. \\nThe requirements process spans the whole \\nsoftware life cycle. Change management and the \\nmaintenance of the requirements in a state that \\naccurately mirrors the software to be built, or that \\nhas been built, are key to the success of the soft -\\nware engineering process. \\nNot every organization has a culture of docu -\\nmenting and managing requirements. It is com -\\nmon in dynamic start-up companies, driven by a \\nstrong “product vision” and limited resources, to \\nview requirements documentation as unnecessary \\noverhead. Most often, however, as these compa -\\nnies expand, as their customer base grows, and \\nas their product starts to evolve, they discover \\nthat they need to recover the requirements that ')),\n",

Hence, requirements \\ndocumentation and change management are key \\nto the success of any requirements process.\\n7.1.\\u2008Iterative\\u2008Nature\\u2008of\\u2008the\\u2008Requirements\\u2008\\nProcess\\nThere is general pressure in the software indus -\\ntry for ever shorter development cycles, and this \\nis particularly pronounced in highly competitive, \\nmarket-driven sectors. Moreover, most projects \\nare constrained in some way by their environment, \\nand many are upgrades to, or revisions of, exist -\\ning software where the architecture is a given. In \\npractice, therefore, it is almost always impractical \\nto implement the requirements process as a linear, \\ndeterministic process in which software require -\\nments are elicited from the stakeholders, base -\\nlined, allocated, and handed over to the software \\ndevelopment team. It is certainly a myth that the \\nrequirements for large software projects are ever \\nperfectly understood or perfectly specified. \\nInstead, requirements typically iterate towards \\na level of quality and detail that is sufficient to \\npermit design and procurement decisions to be \\nmade. In some projects, this may result in the \\nrequirements being baselined before all their \\nproperties are fully understood. This risks expen-\\nsive rework if problems emerge late in the soft -\\nware engineering process. However, software \\nengineers are necessarily constrained by project \\nmanagement plans and must therefore take steps \\nto ensure that the “quality” of the requirements is \\nas high as possible given the available resources. \\nThey should, for example, make explicit any \\nassumptions that underpin the requirements as \\nwell as any known problems.\\nFor software products that are developed iter -\\natively, a project team may baseline only those \\nrequirements needed for the current iteration. The \\nrequirements specialist can continue to develop \\nrequirements for future iterations, while develop-\\ners proceed with design and construction of the \\ncurrent iteration. This approach provides custom-\\ners with business value quickly, while minimiz -\\ning the cost of rework.\\nIn almost all cases, requirements understanding \\ncontinues to evolve as design and development \\nproceeds. This often leads to the revision of \\nrequirements late in the life cycle. Perhaps the \\nmost crucial point in understanding software \\nrequirements is that a significant proportion of \\nthe requirements will change. This is sometimes \\ndue to errors in the analysis, but it is frequently an \\ninevitable consequence of change in the “environ-\\nment”—for example, the customer’s operating \\nor business environment, regulatory processes \\nimposed by the authorities, or the market into \\nwhich software must sell. Whatever the cause, it is \\nimportant to recognize the inevitability of change \\nand take steps to mitigate its effects. Change has \\nto be managed by ensuring that proposed changes \\ngo through a defined review and approval pro -\\ncess and by applying careful requirements trac -\\ning, impact analysis, and software configuration \\nmanagement (see the Software Configuration \\nManagement KA). Hence, the requirements pro -\\ncess is not merely a front-end task in software \\ndevelopment, but spans the whole software life \\ncycle. In a typical project, the software require -\\nments activities evolve over time from elicitation \\nto change management. A combination of top-\\ndown analysis and design methods and bottom-\\nup implementation and refactoring methods that \\nmeet in the middle could provide the best of both \\nworlds. However, this is difficult to achieve in \\npractice, as it depends heavily upon the maturity \\nand expertise of the software engineers.\\n7.2.\\u2008Change\\u2008Management\\nChange management is central to the management \\nof requirements. This topic describes the role of \\nchange management, the procedures that need to \\nbe in place, and the analysis that should be applied \\nto proposed changes. It has strong links to the Soft-\\nware Configuration Management KA.\\n7.3.\\u2008Requirements\\u2008Attributes\\nRequirements should consist not only of a speci -\\nfication of what is required, but also of ancillary \\ninformation, which helps manage and interpret \\nthe requirements. Requirements attributes must \\nbe defined, recorded, and updated as the soft -\\nware under development or maintenance evolves. \\nThis should include the various classification ')),\n",

Tracing is fundamental \\nto performing impact analysis when requirements \\nchange. A requirement should be traceable back-\\nward to the requirements and stakeholders that \\nmotivated it (from a software requirement back \\nto the system requirement(s) that it helps satisfy, \\nfor example). Conversely, a requirement should \\nbe traceable forward into the requirements and \\ndesign entities that satisfy it (for example, from \\na system requirement into the software require -\\nments that have been elaborated from it, and on \\ninto the code modules that implement it, or the \\ntest cases related to that code and even a given \\nsection on the user manual which describes the \\nactual functionality) and into the test case that \\nverifies it.\\nThe requirements tracing for a typical proj -\\nect will form a complex directed acyclic graph \\n(DAG) (see Graphs in the Computing Founda -\\ntions KA) of requirements. Maintaining an up-to-\\ndate graph or traceability matrix is an activity that \\nmust be considered during the whole life cycle \\nof a product. If the traceability information is not \\nupdated as changes in the requirements continue \\nto happen, the traceability information becomes \\nunreliable for impact analysis.\\n7.5.\\u2008Measuring\\u2008Requirements\\nAs a practical matter, it is typically useful to have \\nsome concept of the “volume” of the require -\\nments for a particular software product. This \\nnumber is useful in evaluating the “size” of a \\nchange in requirements, in estimating the cost of \\na development or maintenance task, or simply for \\nuse as the denominator in other measurements. \\nFunctional size measurement (FSM) is a tech -\\nnique for evaluating the size of a body of func -\\ntional requirements. \\nAdditional information on size measurement \\nand standards will be found in the Software Engi-\\nneering Process KA. \\n8. Software Requirements Tools\\nTools for dealing with software requirements fall \\nbroadly into two categories: tools for modeling \\nand tools for managing requirements. \\nRequirements management tools typically sup-\\nport a range of activities—including documenta -\\ntion, tracing, and change management—and have \\nhad a significant impact on practice. Indeed, trac-\\ning and change management are really only prac-\\nticable if supported by a tool. Since requirements \\nmanagement is fundamental to good require -\\nments practice, many organizations have invested \\nin requirements management tools, although \\nmany more manage their requirements in more \\nad hoc and generally less satisfactory ways (e.g., \\nusing spreadsheets).')),\n",

Viewed as a \\nprocess, software design is the software engineer-\\ning life cycle activity in which software require -\\nments are analyzed in order to produce a descrip-\\ntion of the software’s internal structure that will \\nserve as the basis for its construction. A software \\ndesign (the result) describes the software archi -\\ntecture—that is, how software is decomposed \\nand organized into components—and the inter -\\nfaces between those components. It should also \\ndescribe the components at a level of detail that \\nenables their construction.\\nSoftware design plays an important role in \\ndeveloping software: during software design, \\nsoftware engineers produce various models \\nthat form a kind of blueprint of the solution to \\nbe implemented. We can analyze and evaluate \\nthese models to determine whether or not they \\nwill allow us to fulfill the various requirements. \\nWe can also examine and evaluate alternative \\nsolutions and tradeoffs. Finally, we can use the \\nresulting models to plan subsequent development \\nactivities, such as system verification and valida-\\ntion, in addition to using them as inputs and as the \\nstarting point of construction and testing.\\nIn a standard list of software life cycle pro -\\ncesses, such as that in ISO/IEC/IEEE Std. 12207, \\nSoftware\\u2008Life\\u2008Cycle\\u2008Processes [2], software design \\nconsists of two activities that fit between software \\nrequirements analysis and software construction:\\n• Software architectural design (sometimes \\ncalled high-level design): develops top-level \\nstructure and organization of the software \\nand identifies the various components.\\n• Software detailed design: specifies each \\ncomponent in sufficient detail to facilitate its \\nconstruction. \\nThis Software Design knowledge area (KA) \\ndoes not discuss every topic that includes the \\nword “design.” In Tom DeMarco’s terminology \\n[3], the topics discussed in this KA deal mainly \\nwith D-design (decomposition design), the goal \\nof which is to map software into component \\npieces. However, because of its importance in \\nthe field of software architecture, we will also \\naddress FP-design (family pattern design), the \\ngoal of which is to establish exploitable com -\\nmonalities in a family of software products. This \\nKA does not address I-design (invention design), \\nwhich is usually performed during the software \\nrequirements process with the goal of conceptu -\\nalizing and specifying software to satisfy discov-\\nered needs and requirements, since this topic is \\nconsidered to be part of the requirements process \\n(see the Software Requirements KA).\\nThis Software Design KA is related specifi -\\ncally to the Software Requirements, Software ')),\n",

Software Design Fundamentals\\nThe concepts, notions, and terminology intro -\\nduced here form an underlying basis for under -\\nstanding the role and scope of software design.\\n1.1. General\\u2008Design\\u2008Concepts\\n[4*, c1]\\nIn the general sense, design can be viewed as a \\nform of problem solving. For example, the con -\\ncept of a wicked problem—a problem with no \\ndefinitive solution—is interesting in terms of \\nunderstanding the limits of design. A number of \\nother notions and concepts are also of interest in \\nunderstanding design in its general sense: goals, \\nconstraints, alternatives, representations, and \\nsolutions (see Problem Solving Techniques in the \\nComputing Foundations KA).\\n1.2. Context\\u2008of\\u2008Software\\u2008Design\\n[4*, c3]\\nSoftware design is an important part of the soft -\\nware development process. To understand the \\nrole of software design, we must see how it fits \\nin the software development life cycle. Thus, it \\nis important to understand the major characteris -\\ntics of software requirements analysis, software \\ndesign, software construction, software testing, \\nand software maintenance.\\n1.3. Software\\u2008Design\\u2008Process\\n[4*, c2]\\nSoftware design is generally considered a two-\\nstep process: \\nFigure 2.1. Breakdown of Topics for the Software Design KA')),\n",

Software\\u2008Design\\u2008Principles\\n[4*] [5*, c6, c7, c21] [6*, c1, c8, c9]\\nA principle is “a comprehensive and fundamen -\\ntal law, doctrine, or assumption” [7]. Software \\ndesign principles are key notions that provide \\nthe basis for many different software design \\napproaches and concepts. Software design princi-\\nples include abstraction; coupling and cohesion; \\ndecomposition and modularization; encapsula -\\ntion/information hiding; separation of interface \\nand implementation; sufficiency, completeness, \\nand primitiveness; and separation of concerns.\\n• Abstraction is “a view of an object that \\nfocuses on the information relevant to a \\nparticular purpose and ignores the remain -\\nder of the information” [1] (see Abstraction \\nin the Computing Foundations KA). In the \\ncontext of software design, two key abstrac -\\ntion mechanisms are parameterization and \\nspecification. Abstraction by parameteriza -\\ntion abstracts from the details of data repre -\\nsentations by representing the data as named \\nparameters. Abstraction by specification \\nleads to three major kinds of abstraction: \\nprocedural abstraction, data abstraction, and \\ncontrol (iteration) abstraction. \\n• Coupling\\u2008and\\u2008Cohesion.\\u2008Coupling is defined \\nas “a measure of the interdependence among \\nmodules in a computer program,” whereas \\ncohesion is defined as “a measure of the \\nstrength of association of the elements within \\na module” [1].\\n• Decomposition\\u2008and\\u2008modularization.\\u2008Decom-\\nposing and modularizing  means that large \\nsoftware is divided into a number of smaller \\nnamed components having well-defined \\ninterfaces that describe component interac -\\ntions. Usually the goal is to place different \\nfunctionalities and responsibilities in differ -\\nent components.  \\n• Encapsulation\\u2008and\\u2008information\\u2008hiding means \\ngrouping and packaging the internal details \\nof an abstraction and making those details \\ninaccessible to external entities. \\n• Separation\\u2008of\\u2008interface\\u2008and\\u2008implementation.\\u2008\\nSeparating interface and implementation \\ninvolves defining a component by specify -\\ning a public interface (known to the clients) \\nthat is separate from the details of how the \\ncomponent is realized (see encapsulation and \\ninformation hiding above). \\n• Sufficiency,\\u2008completeness,\\u2008and\\u2008primitiveness.\\u2008\\nAchieving sufficiency and completeness  \\nmeans ensuring that a software component \\ncaptures all the important characteristics of \\nan abstraction and nothing more. Primitive -\\nness means the design should be based on \\npatterns that are easy to implement.\\n• Separation\\u2008of\\u2008concerns.\\u2008A concern  is an \\n“area of interest with respect to a software \\ndesign” [8]. A design concern is an area of \\ndesign that is relevant to one or more of its \\nstakeholders. Each architecture view frames \\none or more concerns. Separating concerns \\nby views allows interested stakeholders to \\nfocus on a few things at a time and offers a \\nmeans of managing complexity [9].\\n2. Key Issues in Software Design\\nA number of key issues must be dealt with when \\ndesigning software. Some are quality concerns \\nthat all software must address—for example, \\nperformance, security, reliability, usability, etc. \\nAnother important issue is how to decompose, \\norganize, and package software components. \\nThis is so fundamental that all design approaches \\naddress it in one way or another (see section 1.4, \\nSoftware Design Principles,  and topic 7, Soft -\\nware Design Strategies and Methods). In contrast, \\nother issues “deal with some aspect of software’s \\nbehavior that is not in the application domain, \\nbut which addresses some of the supporting ')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 52}, page_content='2-4 SWEBOK® Guide V3.0\\ndomains” [10]. Such issues, which often crosscut \\nthe system’s functionality, have been referred to \\nas aspects, which “tend not to be units of soft -\\nware’s functional decomposition, but rather to be \\nproperties that affect the performance or seman -\\ntics of the components in systemic ways” [11]. \\nA number of these key, crosscutting issues are \\ndiscussed in the following sections (presented in \\nalphabetical order).\\n2.1. Concurrency\\n[5*, c18]\\nDesign for concurrency is concerned with decom-\\nposing software into processes, tasks, and threads \\nand dealing with related issues of efficiency, \\natomicity, synchronization, and scheduling. \\n2.2. Control\\u2008and\\u2008Handling\\u2008of\\u2008Events\\n[5*, c21]\\nThis design issue is concerned with how to \\norganize data and control flow as well as how \\nto handle reactive and temporal events through \\nvarious mechanisms such as implicit invocation \\nand call-backs.\\n2.3. Data\\u2008Persistence\\u2008\\n[12*, c9]\\nThis design issue is concerned with how to han -\\ndle long-lived data. \\n2.4. Distribution\\u2008of\\u2008Components\\n[5*, c18]\\nThis design issue is concerned with how to dis -\\ntribute the software across the hardware (includ -\\ning computer hardware and network hardware), \\nhow the components communicate, and how \\nmiddleware can be used to deal with heteroge -\\nneous software. \\n2.5. Error\\u2008and\\u2008Exception\\u2008Handling\\u2008and\\u2008Fault\\u2008\\nTolerance\\n[5*, c18]\\nThis design issue is concerned with how to pre -\\nvent, tolerate, and process errors and deal with \\nexceptional conditions. \\n2.6. Interaction\\u2008and\\u2008Presentation\\u2008\\n[5*, c16]\\nThis design issue is concerned with how to struc-\\nture and organize interactions with users as well \\nas the presentation of information (for example, \\nseparation of presentation and business logic \\nusing the Model-View-Controller approach). \\nNote that this topic does not specify user interface \\ndetails, which is the task of user interface design \\n(see topic 4, User Interface Design).\\n2.7.\\u2008Security\\n[5*, c12, c18] [13*, c4]\\nDesign for security is concerned with how to pre-\\nvent unauthorized disclosure, creation, change, \\ndeletion, or denial of access to information and \\nother resources. It is also concerned with how to \\ntolerate security-related attacks or violations by \\nlimiting damage, continuing service, speeding \\nrepair and recovery, and failing and recovering \\nsecurely. Access control is a fundamental con -\\ncept of security, and one should also ensure the \\nproper use of cryptology.\\n3. Software Structure and Architecture\\nIn its strict sense, a software architecture is \\n“the set of structures needed to reason about \\nthe system, which comprise software elements, \\nrelations among them, and properties of both” \\n[14*]. During the mid-1990s, however, soft -\\nware architecture started to emerge as a broader \\ndiscipline that involved the study of software \\nstructures and architectures in a more generic \\nway. This gave rise to a number of interesting \\nconcepts about software design at different lev -\\nels of abstraction. Some of these concepts can \\nbe useful during the architectural design (for \\nexample, architectural styles) as well as during \\nthe detailed design (for example, design pat -\\nterns). These design concepts can also be used \\nto design families of programs (also known as \\nproduct lines). Interestingly, most of these con -\\ncepts can be seen as attempts to describe, and \\nthus reuse, design knowledge.')),\n",

Architectural\\u2008Structures\\u2008and\\u2008Viewpoints\\n[14*, c1]\\nDifferent high-level facets of a software design \\ncan be described and documented. These facets \\nare often called views: “A view represents a partial \\naspect of a software architecture that shows spe -\\ncific properties of a software system” [14*]. Views \\npertain to distinct issues associated with software \\ndesign—for example, the logical view (satisfying \\nthe functional requirements) vs. the process view \\n(concurrency issues) vs. the physical view (distri-\\nbution issues) vs. the development view (how the \\ndesign is broken down into implementation units \\nwith explicit representation of the dependencies \\namong the units). Various authors use different \\nterminologies—like behavioral vs. functional vs. \\nstructural vs. data modeling views. In summary, a \\nsoftware design is a multifaceted artifact produced \\nby the design process and generally composed of \\nrelatively independent and orthogonal views. \\n3.2. Architectural\\u2008Styles\\n[14*, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5]\\nAn architectural style is “a specialization of ele -\\nment and relation types, together with a set of \\nconstraints on how they can be used” [14*]. An \\narchitectural style can thus be seen as providing \\nthe software’s high-level organization. Various \\nauthors have identified a number of major archi -\\ntectural styles: \\n• General structures (for example, layers, pipes \\nand filters, blackboard)\\n• Distributed systems (for example, client-\\nserver, three-tiers, broker)\\n• Interactive systems (for example, Model-View-\\nController, Presentation-Abstraction-Control)\\n• Adaptable systems (for example, microker -\\nnel, reflection)\\n• Others (for example, batch, interpreters, pro-\\ncess control, rule-based).\\n3.3. Design\\u2008Patterns\\n[15*, c3, c4, c5]\\nSuccinctly described, a pattern is “a common \\nsolution to a common problem in a given context” \\n[16]. While architectural styles can be viewed as \\npatterns describing the high-level organization \\nof software, other design patterns can be used \\nto describe details at a lower level. These lower \\nlevel design patterns include the following: \\n• Creational patterns (for example, builder, \\nfactory, prototype, singleton)\\n• Structural patterns (for example, adapter, \\nbridge, composite, decorator, façade, fly -\\nweight, proxy)\\n• Behavioral patterns (for example, command, \\ninterpreter, iterator, mediator, memento, \\nobserver, state, strategy, template, visitor).\\n3.4. Architecture\\u2008Design\\u2008Decisions\\n[5*, c6]\\nArchitectural design is a creative process. Dur -\\ning the design process, software designers have \\nto make a number of fundamental decisions that \\nprofoundly affect the software and the develop -\\nment process. It is useful to think of the archi -\\ntectural design process from a decision-making \\nperspective rather than from an activity perspec -\\ntive. Often, the impact on quality attributes and \\ntradeoffs among competing quality attributes are \\nthe basis for design decisions.\\n3.5. Families\\u2008of\\u2008Programs\\u2008and\\u2008Frameworks\\u2008\\n[5*, c6, c7, c16]\\nOne approach to providing for reuse of software \\ndesigns and components is to design families of \\nprograms, also known as software product lines . \\nThis can be done by identifying the commonalities \\namong members of such families and by designing \\nreusable and customizable components to account \\nfor the variability among family members. \\nIn object-oriented (OO) programming, a key \\nrelated notion is that of a framework : a partially \\ncompleted software system that can be extended \\nby appropriately instantiating specific extensions \\n(such as plug-ins). \\n4. User Interface Design \\nUser interface design is an essential part of the \\nsoftware design process. User interface design \\nshould ensure that interaction between the human \\nand the machine provides for effective operation ')),\n",

For software to \\nachieve its full potential, the user interface should \\nbe designed to match the skills, experience, and \\nexpectations of its anticipated users.\\n4.1. General\\u2008User\\u2008Interface\\u2008Design\\u2008Principles\\n[5*, c29-web] [17*, c2]1\\n• Learnability. The software should be easy to \\nlearn so that the user can rapidly start work -\\ning with the software.\\n• User\\u2008familiarity. The interface should use \\nterms and concepts drawn from the experi -\\nences of the people who will use the software.\\n• Consistency. The interface should be consis-\\ntent so that comparable operations are acti -\\nvated in the same way.\\n• Minimal\\u2008surprise.\\u2008The behavior of software \\nshould not surprise users.\\n• Recoverability.\\u2008The interface should provide \\nmechanisms allowing users to recover from \\nerrors.\\n• User\\u2008guidance.\\u2008The interface should give \\nmeaningful feedback when errors occur and \\nprovide context-related help to users.\\n• User\\u2008diversity. The interface should pro -\\nvide appropriate interaction mechanisms \\nfor diverse types of users and for users with \\ndifferent capabilities (blind, poor eyesight, \\ndeaf, colorblind, etc.).\\n4.2. User\\u2008Interface\\u2008Design\\u2008Issues\\n[5*, c29-web] [17*, c2]\\nUser interface design should solve two key issues:\\n• How should the user interact with the \\nsoftware?\\n• How should information from the software \\nbe presented to the user?\\nUser interface design must integrate user \\ninteraction and information presentation. User \\ninterface design should consider a compromise \\nbetween the most appropriate styles of interaction \\n1 Chapter 29 is a web-based chapter available \\nat http://ifs.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Books/SE9/\\nWebChapters/.\\nand presentation for the software, the background \\nand experience of the software users, and the \\navailable devices.\\n4.3. The\\u2008Design\\u2008of\\u2008User\\u2008Interaction\\u2008Modalities\\n[5*, c29-web] [17*, c2]\\nUser interaction involves issuing commands and \\nproviding associated data to the software. User \\ninteraction styles can be classified into the fol -\\nlowing primary styles:\\n• Question-answer.\\u2008The interaction is essen -\\ntially restricted to a single question-answer \\nexchange between the user and the software. \\nThe user issues a question to the software, \\nand the software returns the answer to the \\nquestion. \\n• Direct\\u2008 manipulation. Users interact with \\nobjects on the computer screen. Direct \\nmanipulation often includes a pointing \\ndevice (such as a mouse, trackball, or a fin -\\nger on touch screens) that manipulates an \\nobject and invokes actions that specify what \\nis to be done with that object.\\n• Menu\\u2008selection. The user selects a command \\nfrom a menu list of commands. \\n• Form\\u2008fill-in. The user fills in the fields of a \\nform. Sometimes fields include menus, in \\nwhich case the form has action buttons for \\nthe user to initiate action.\\n• Command\\u2008language. The user issues a com -\\nmand and provides related parameters to \\ndirect the software what to do. \\n• Natural\\u2008language. The user issues a com -\\nmand in natural language. That is, the natural \\nlanguage is a front end to a command lan -\\nguage and is parsed and translated into soft -\\nware commands.\\n4.4. The\\u2008Design\\u2008of\\u2008Information\\u2008Presentation\\n[5*, c29-web] [17*, c2]\\nInformation presentation may be textual or graphi-\\ncal in nature. A good design keeps the information \\npresentation separate from the information itself. \\nThe MVC (Model-View-Controller) approach is \\nan effective way to keep information presentation \\nseparating from the information being presented.')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='Software Design 2-7\\nSoftware engineers also consider software \\nresponse time and feedback in the design of infor-\\nmation presentation. Response time is generally \\nmeasured from the point at which a user executes \\na certain control action until the software responds \\nwith a response. An indication of progress is desir-\\nable while the software is preparing the response. \\nFeedback can be provided by restating the user’s \\ninput while processing is being completed.\\nAbstract visualizations can be used when large \\namounts of information are to be presented.\\nAccording to the style of information presenta-\\ntion, designers can also use color to enhance the \\ninterface. There are several important guidelines:\\n• Limit the number of colors used.\\n• Use color change to show the change of soft-\\nware status. \\n• Use color-coding to support the user’s task.\\n• Use color-coding in a thoughtful and consis-\\ntent way.\\n• Use colors to facilitate access for people \\nwith color blindness or color deficiency \\n(e.g., use the change of color saturation and \\ncolor brightness, try to avoid blue and red \\ncombinations).\\n• Don’t depend on color alone to convey \\nimportant information to users with different \\ncapabilities (blindness, poor eyesight, color -\\nblindness, etc.). \\n4.5. User\\u2008Interface\\u2008Design\\u2008Process\\n[5*, c29-web] [17*, c2]\\nUser interface design is an iterative process; \\ninterface prototypes are often used to determine \\nthe features, organization, and look of the soft -\\nware user interface. This process includes three \\ncore activities:\\n• User\\u2008analysis.\\u2008In this phase, the designer ana-\\nlyzes the users’ tasks, the working environ -\\nment, other software, and how users interact \\nwith other people. \\n• Software\\u2008prototyping.\\u2008Developing prototype \\nsoftware help users to guide the evolution of \\nthe interface.\\n• Interface\\u2008evaluation.\\u2008Designers can observe \\nusers’ experiences with the evolving interface. \\n4.6. Localization\\u2008and\\u2008Internationalization\\n[17*, c8, c9]\\nUser interface design often needs to consider inter-\\nnationalization and localization, which are means \\nof adapting software to the different languages, \\nregional differences, and the technical require -\\nments of a target market. Internationalization is the \\nprocess of designing a software application so that \\nit can be adapted to various languages and regions \\nwithout major engineering changes. Localization \\nis the process of adapting internationalized soft -\\nware for a specific region or language by adding \\nlocale-specific components and translating the \\ntext. Localization and internationalization should \\nconsider factors such as symbols, numbers, cur -\\nrency, time, and measurement units.\\n4.7.\\u2008Metaphors\\u2008and\\u2008Conceptual\\u2008Models\\n[17*, c5]\\nUser interface designers can use metaphors and \\nconceptual models to set up mappings between the \\nsoftware and some reference system known to the \\nusers in the real world, which can help the users to \\nmore readily learn and use the interface. For exam-\\nple, the operation “delete file” can be made into a \\nmetaphor using the icon of a trash can. \\nWhen designing a user interface, software engi-\\nneers should be careful to not use more than one \\nmetaphor for each concept. Metaphors also pres -\\nent potential problems with respect to internation-\\nalization, since not all metaphors are meaningful \\nor are applied in the same way within all cultures.\\n5. Software Design Quality Analysis and \\nEvaluation\\nThis section includes a number of quality anal -\\nysis and evaluation topics that are specifically \\nrelated to software design. (See also the Software \\nQuality KA.)\\n5.1. Quality\\u2008Attributes\\n[4*, c4]\\nVarious attributes contribute to the quality of \\na software design, including various “-ilities” \\n(maintainability, portability, testability, usability) ')),\n",

There is \\nan interesting distinction between quality attri -\\nbutes discernible at runtime (for example, per -\\nformance, security, availability, functionality, \\nusability), those not discernible at runtime (for \\nexample, modifiability, portability, reusability, \\ntestability), and those related to the architecture’s \\nintrinsic qualities (for example, conceptual integ-\\nrity, correctness, completeness). (See also the \\nSoftware Quality KA.)\\n5.2. Quality\\u2008Analysis\\u2008and\\u2008Evaluation\\u2008Techniques\\n[4*, c4] [5*, c24]\\nVarious tools and techniques can help in analyz -\\ning and evaluating software design quality. \\n• Software design reviews: informal and for -\\nmalized techniques to determine the quality \\nof design artifacts (for example, architecture \\nreviews, design reviews, and inspections; \\nscenario-based techniques; requirements \\ntracing). Software design reviews can also \\nevaluate security. Aids for installation, oper-\\nation, and usage (for example, manuals and \\nhelp files) can be reviewed.\\n• Static analysis: formal or semiformal static \\n(nonexecutable) analysis that can be used \\nto evaluate a design (for example, fault-\\ntree analysis or automated cross-checking). \\nDesign vulnerability analysis (for example, \\nstatic analysis for security weaknesses) can \\nbe performed if security is a concern. Formal \\ndesign analysis uses mathematical models \\nthat allow designers to predicate the behavior \\nand validate the performance of the software \\ninstead of having to rely entirely on testing. \\nFormal design analysis can be used to detect \\nresidual specification and design errors (per-\\nhaps caused by imprecision, ambiguity, and \\nsometimes other kinds of mistakes). (See \\nalso the Software Engineering Models and \\nMethods KA.)\\n• Simulation and prototyping: dynamic tech -\\nniques to evaluate a design (for example, \\nperformance simulation or feasibility \\nprototypes).\\n5.3. Measures\\n[4*, c4] [5*, c24]\\nMeasures can be used to assess or to quanti -\\ntatively estimate various aspects of a software \\ndesign; for example, size, structure, or quality. \\nMost measures that have been proposed depend \\non the approach used for producing the design. \\nThese measures are classified in two broad \\ncategories:\\n• Function-based (structured) design mea -\\nsures: measures obtained by analyzing func-\\ntional decomposition; generally represented \\nusing a structure chart (sometimes called a \\nhierarchical diagram) on which various mea-\\nsures can be computed.\\n• Object-oriented design measures: the design \\nstructure is typically represented as a class \\ndiagram, on which various measures can be \\ncomputed. Measures on the properties of the \\ninternal content of each class can also be \\ncomputed.\\n6. Software Design Notations\\nMany notations exist to represent software design \\nartifacts. Some are used to describe the structural \\norganization of a design, others to represent soft-\\nware behavior. Certain notations are used mostly \\nduring architectural design and others mainly \\nduring detailed design, although some nota -\\ntions can be used for both purposes. In addition, \\nsome notations are used mostly in the context of \\nspecific design methods (see topic 7, Software \\nDesign Strategies and Methods). Please note that \\nsoftware design is often accomplished using mul-\\ntiple notations. Here, they are categorized into \\nnotations for describing the structural (static) \\nview vs. the behavioral (dynamic) view.\\n6.1.

Software Design Strategies and Methods\\nThere exist various general strategies to help \\nguide the design process. In contrast with general \\nstrategies, methods are more specific in that they \\ngenerally provide a set of notations to be used \\nwith the method, a description of the process to \\nbe used when following the method, and a set of \\nguidelines for using the method. Such methods \\nare useful as a common framework for teams of \\nsoftware engineers.

Structured design is generally used \\nafter structured analysis, thus producing (among \\nother things) data flow diagrams and associated \\nprocess descriptions. Researchers have proposed \\nvarious strategies (for example, transformation \\nanalysis, transaction analysis) and heuristics (for \\nexample, fan-in/fan-out, scope of effect vs. scope \\nof control) to transform a DFD into a software \\narchitecture generally represented as a structure \\nchart.\\n7.3.\\u2008Object-Oriented\\u2008Design\\n[4*, c16]\\nNumerous software design methods based \\non objects have been proposed. The field has \\nevolved from the early object-oriented (OO) \\ndesign of the mid-1980s (noun = object; verb \\n= method; adjective = attribute), where inheri -\\ntance and polymorphism play a key role, to the \\nfield of component-based design, where metain -\\nformation can be defined and accessed (through \\nreflection, for example). Although OO design’s \\nroots stem from the concept of data abstraction, \\nresponsibility-driven design has been proposed \\nas an alternative approach to OO design.\\n7.4.\\u2008Data\\u2008Structure-Centered\\u2008Design\\n[4*, c14, c15]\\nData structure-centered design starts from the data \\nstructures a program manipulates rather than from \\nthe function it performs. The software engineer \\nfirst describes the input and output data structures \\nand then develops the program’s control structure \\nbased on these data structure diagrams. Various \\nheuristics have been proposed to deal with special \\ncases—for example, when there is a mismatch \\nbetween the input and output structures.\\n7.5.\\u2008Component-Based\\u2008Design\\u2008(CBD)\\n[4*, c17]\\nA software component is an independent unit, \\nhaving well-defined interfaces and dependen -\\ncies that can be composed and deployed inde -\\npendently. Component-based design addresses \\nissues related to providing, developing, and \\nintegrating such components in order to improve \\nreuse. Reused and off-the-shelf software com -\\nponents should meet the same security require -\\nments as new software.

Boundar-\\nies between design, construction, and testing (if \\nany) will vary depending on the software life cycle \\nprocesses that are used in a project.\\nAlthough some detailed design may be per -\\nformed prior to construction, much design work \\nis performed during the construction activity. \\nThus, the Software Construction KA is closely \\nlinked to the Software Design KA.\\nThroughout construction, software engineers \\nboth unit test and integration test their work. \\nThus, the Software Construction KA is closely \\nlinked to the Software Testing KA as well.\\nSoftware construction typically produces the \\nhighest number of configuration items that need \\nto be managed in a software project (source files, \\ndocumentation, test cases, and so on). Thus, the \\nSoftware Construction KA is also closely linked \\nto the Software Configuration Management KA.\\nWhile software quality is important in all the \\nKAs, code is the ultimate deliverable of a soft -\\nware project, and thus the Software Quality KA is \\nclosely linked to the Software Construction KA.\\nSince software construction requires knowledge \\nof algorithms and of coding practices, it is closely \\nrelated to the Computing Foundations KA, which \\nis concerned with the computer science founda -\\ntions that support the design and construction of \\nsoftware products. It is also related to project man-\\nagement, insofar as the management of construc-\\ntion can present considerable challenges.\\nBREAKDOWN OF TOPICS FOR \\nSOFTWARE CONSTRUCTION\\nFigure 3.1 gives a graphical representation of the \\ntop-level decomposition of the breakdown for the \\nSoftware Construction KA. \\n1.

Minimizing\\u2008Complexity\\n[1*]\\nMost people are limited in their ability to hold \\ncomplex structures and information in their \\nworking memories, especially over long peri -\\nods of time. This proves to be a major factor \\ninfluencing how people convey intent to com -\\nputers and leads to one of the strongest drives \\nin software construction: minimizing complex -\\nity. The need to reduce complexity applies to \\nessentially every aspect of software construction \\nand is particularly critical to testing of software \\nconstructions.\\nIn software construction, reduced complexity \\nis achieved through emphasizing code creation \\nthat is simple and readable rather than clever. It \\nis accomplished through making use of standards \\n(see section 1.5, Standards in Construction), \\nmodular design (see section 3.1, Construction \\nDesign), and numerous other specific techniques \\n(see section 3.3, Coding). It is also supported by \\nconstruction-focused quality techniques (see sec-\\ntion 3.7, Construction Quality).\\n1.2. Anticipating\\u2008Change\\u2008\\n[1*]\\nMost software will change over time, and the \\nanticipation of change drives many aspects of \\nsoftware construction; changes in the environ -\\nments in which software operates also affect soft-\\nware in diverse ways.\\nAnticipating change helps software engineers \\nbuild extensible software, which means they can \\nenhance a software product without disrupting \\nthe underlying structure.\\nAnticipating change is supported by many spe-\\ncific techniques (see section 3.3, Coding).\\n1.3. Constructing\\u2008for\\u2008Verification\\n[1*]\\nConstructing for verification means building \\nsoftware in such a way that faults can be read -\\nily found by the software engineers writing the \\nsoftware as well as by the testers and users during \\nindependent testing and operational activities. \\nSpecific techniques that support constructing for \\nverification include following coding standards to \\nsupport code reviews and unit testing, organizing \\ncode to support automated testing, and restrict -\\ning the use of complex or hard-to-understand lan-\\nguage structures, among others. \\n1.4. Reuse\\n[2*]\\nReuse refers to using existing assets in solving \\ndifferent problems. In software construction, typ-\\nical assets that are reused include libraries, mod -\\nules, components, source code, and commercial \\noff-the-shelf (COTS) assets. Reuse is best prac -\\nticed systematically, according to a well-defined, \\nrepeatable process. Systematic reuse can enable \\nsignificant software productivity, quality, and \\ncost improvements.\\nReuse has two closely related facets: “construc-\\ntion for reuse” and “construction with reuse.” The \\nformer means to create reusable software assets, \\nwhile the latter means to reuse software assets in \\nthe construction of a new solution. Reuse often \\ntranscends the boundary of projects, which means \\nreused assets can be constructed in other projects \\nor organizations.\\n1.5. Standards\\u2008in\\u2008Construction\\u2008\\n[1*]\\nApplying external or internal development stan -\\ndards during construction helps achieve a proj -\\nect’s objectives for efficiency, quality, and cost. \\nSpecifically, the choices of allowable program -\\nming language subsets and usage standards are \\nimportant aids in achieving higher security.\\nStandards that directly affect construction \\nissues include\\n• communication methods (for example, stan -\\ndards for document formats and contents)\\n• programming languages (for example, lan -\\nguage standards for languages like Java and \\nC++)\\n• coding standards (for example, standards for \\nnaming conventions, layout, and indentation)\\n• platforms (for example, interface standards \\nfor operating system calls)')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 68}, page_content='3-4 SWEBOK® Guide V3.0\\n• tools (for example, diagrammatic standards \\nfor notations like UML (Unified Modeling \\nLanguage)).\\nUse\\u2008 of\\u2008 external\\u2008 standards. Construction \\ndepends on the use of external standards for con-\\nstruction languages, construction tools, technical \\ninterfaces, and interactions between the Software \\nConstruction KA and other KAs. Standards come \\nfrom numerous sources, including hardware and \\nsoftware interface specifications (such as the \\nObject Management Group (OMG)) and interna-\\ntional organizations (such as the IEEE or ISO).\\nUse\\u2008of\\u2008internal\\u2008standards. Standards may also \\nbe created on an organizational basis at the cor -\\nporate level or for use on specific projects. These \\nstandards support coordination of group activi -\\nties, minimizing complexity, anticipating change, \\nand constructing for verification.\\n2. Managing Construction\\n2.1. Construction\\u2008in\\u2008Life\\u2008Cycle\\u2008Models\\n[1*]\\nNumerous models have been created to develop \\nsoftware; some emphasize construction more \\nthan others. \\nSome models are more linear from the con -\\nstruction point of view—such as the waterfall and \\nstaged-delivery life cycle models. These models \\ntreat construction as an activity that occurs only \\nafter significant prerequisite work has been com-\\npleted—including detailed requirements work, \\nextensive design work, and detailed planning. \\nThe more linear approaches tend to emphasize \\nthe activities that precede construction (require -\\nments and design) and to create more distinct sep-\\narations between activities. In these models, the \\nmain emphasis of construction may be coding.\\nOther models are more iterative—such as \\nevolutionary prototyping and agile develop -\\nment. These approaches tend to treat construc -\\ntion as an activity that occurs concurrently with \\nother software development activities (including \\nrequirements, design, and planning) or that over-\\nlaps them. These approaches tend to mix design, \\ncoding, and testing activities, and they often treat \\nthe combination of activities as construction (see \\nthe Software Management and Software Process \\nKAs).\\nConsequently, what is considered to be “con -\\nstruction” depends to some degree on the life \\ncycle model used. In general, software con -\\nstruction is mostly coding and debugging, but \\nit also involves construction planning, detailed \\ndesign, unit testing, integration testing, and other \\nactivities.\\n2.2. Construction\\u2008Planning\\n[1*]\\nThe choice of construction method is a key aspect \\nof the construction-planning activity. The choice \\nof construction method affects the extent to \\nwhich construction prerequisites are performed, \\nthe order in which they are performed, and the \\ndegree to which they should be completed before \\nconstruction work begins.\\nThe approach to construction affects the proj -\\nect team’s ability to reduce complexity, anticipate \\nchange, and construct for verification. Each of \\nthese objectives may also be addressed at the pro-\\ncess, requirements, and design levels—but they \\nwill be influenced by the choice of construction \\nmethod.\\nConstruction planning also defines the order \\nin which components are created and integrated, \\nthe integration strategy (for example, phased or \\nincremental integration), the software quality \\nmanagement processes, the allocation of task \\nassignments to specific software engineers, and \\nother tasks, according to the chosen method.\\n2.3. Construction\\u2008Measurement\\u2008\\n[1*]\\nNumerous construction activities and artifacts can \\nbe measured—including code developed, code \\nmodified, code reused, code destroyed, code com-\\nplexity, code inspection statistics, fault-fix and \\nfault-find rates, effort, and scheduling. These mea-\\nsurements can be useful for purposes of managing \\nconstruction, ensuring quality during construction, \\nand improving the construction process, among \\nother uses (see the Software Engineering Process \\nKA for more on measurement).')),\n",

Practical Considerations\\nConstruction is an activity in which the software \\nengineer has to deal with sometimes chaotic and \\nchanging real-world constraints, and he or she \\nmust do so precisely. Due to the influence of real-\\nworld constraints, construction is more driven by \\npractical considerations than some other KAs, \\nand software engineering is perhaps most craft-\\nlike in the construction activities.\\n3.1. Construction\\u2008Design\\n[1*]\\nSome projects allocate considerable design activ-\\nity to construction, while others allocate design \\nto a phase explicitly focused on design. Regard -\\nless of the exact allocation, some detailed design \\nwork will occur at the construction level, and that \\ndesign work tends to be dictated by constraints \\nimposed by the real-world problem that is being \\naddressed by the software.\\nJust as construction workers building a physi -\\ncal structure must make small-scale modifica -\\ntions to account for unanticipated gaps in the \\nbuilder’s plans, software construction workers \\nmust make modifications on a smaller or larger \\nscale to flesh out details of the software design \\nduring construction.\\nThe details of the design activity at the construc-\\ntion level are essentially the same as described in \\nthe Software Design KA, but they are applied on \\na smaller scale of algorithms, data structures, and \\ninterfaces. \\n3.2. Construction\\u2008Languages\\n[1*]\\nConstruction languages include all forms of \\ncommunication by which a human can specify an \\nexecutable problem solution to a problem. Con -\\nstruction languages and their implementations \\n(for example, compilers) can affect software \\nquality attributes of performance, reliability, por-\\ntability, and so forth. They can be serious con -\\ntributors to security vulnerabilities.\\nThe simplest type of construction language \\nis a configuration\\u2008language, in which software \\nengineers choose from a limited set of pre -\\ndefined options to create new or custom software \\ninstallations. The text-based configuration files \\nused in both the Windows and Unix operating \\nsystems are examples of this, and the menu-style \\nselection lists of some program generators consti-\\ntute another example of a configuration language.\\nToolkit\\u2008languages are used to build applica -\\ntions out of elements in toolkits (integrated sets \\nof application-specific reusable parts); they are \\nmore complex than configuration languages. \\nToolkit languages may be explicitly defined as \\napplication programming languages, or the appli-\\ncations may simply be implied by a toolkit’s set \\nof interfaces.\\nScripting\\u2008languages are commonly used kinds \\nof application programming languages. In some \\nscripting languages, scripts are called batch files \\nor macros.\\nProgramming\\u2008languages are the most flexible \\ntype of construction languages. They also contain \\nthe least amount of information about specific \\napplication areas and development processes—\\ntherefore, they require the most training and skill \\nto use effectively. The choice of programming lan-\\nguage can have a large effect on the likelihood of \\nvulnerabilities being introduced during coding—\\nfor example, uncritical usage of C and C++ are \\nquestionable choices from a security viewpoint.\\nThere are three general kinds of notation used \\nfor programming languages, namely\\n• linguistic (e.g., C/C++, Java)\\n• formal (e.g., Event-B)\\n• visual (e.g., MatLab).\\nLinguistic\\u2008notations\\u2008are distinguished in par -\\nticular by the use of textual strings to represent \\ncomplex software constructions. The combina -\\ntion of textual strings into patterns may have a \\nsentence-like syntax. Properly used, each such \\nstring should have a strong semantic connotation \\nproviding an immediate intuitive understanding \\nof what will happen when the software construc -\\ntion is executed.\\nFormal\\u2008notations\\u2008rely less on intuitive, every -\\nday meanings of words and text strings and more \\non definitions backed up by precise, unambigu -\\nous, and formal (or mathematical) definitions. \\nFormal construction notations and formal meth -\\nods are at the semantic base of most forms of ')),\n",

For -\\nmal constructions also use precisely defined ways \\nof combining symbols that avoid the ambiguity \\nof many natural language constructions.\\nVisual\\u2008notations rely much less on the textual \\nnotations of linguistic and formal construction \\nand instead rely on direct visual interpretation \\nand placement of visual entities that represent the \\nunderlying software. Visual construction tends to \\nbe somewhat limited by the difficulty of making \\n“complex” statements using only the arrange -\\nment of icons on a display. However, these icons \\ncan be powerful tools in cases where the primary \\nprogramming task is simply to build and “adjust” \\na visual interface to a program, the detailed \\nbehavior of which has an underlying definition.\\n3.3. Coding\\n[1*]\\nThe following considerations apply to the soft -\\nware construction coding activity:\\n• Techniques for creating understandable \\nsource code, including naming conventions \\nand source code layout;\\n• Use of classes, enumerated types, variables, \\nnamed constants, and other similar entities;\\n• Use of control structures; \\n• Handling of error conditions—both antici -\\npated and exceptional (input of bad data, for \\nexample);\\n• Prevention of code-level security breaches \\n(buffer overflows or array index bounds, for \\nexample);\\n• Resource usage via use of exclusion mecha -\\nnisms and discipline in accessing serially \\nreusable resources (including threads and \\ndatabase locks);\\n• Source code organization (into state -\\nments, routines, classes, packages, or other \\nstructures);\\n• Code documentation;\\n• Code tuning,\\n3.4. Construction\\u2008Testing\\n[1*]\\nConstruction involves two forms of testing, \\nwhich are often performed by the software engi -\\nneer who wrote the code:\\n• Unit testing\\n• Integration testing.\\nThe purpose of construction testing is to reduce \\nthe gap between the time when faults are inserted \\ninto the code and the time when those faults are \\ndetected, thereby reducing the cost incurred to \\nfix them. In some instances, test cases are writ -\\nten after code has been written. In other instances, \\ntest cases may be created before code is written.\\nConstruction testing typically involves a \\nsubset of the various types of testing, which \\nare described in the Software Testing KA. For \\ninstance, construction testing does not typically \\ninclude system testing, alpha testing, beta testing, \\nstress testing, configuration testing, usability test-\\ning, or other more specialized kinds of testing. \\nTwo standards have been published on the topic \\nof construction testing: IEEE Standard 829-1998,\\u2008\\nIEEE Standard\\u2008for\\u2008Software\\u2008Test\\u2008Documentation, \\nand IEEE Standard 1008-1987, IEEE\\u2008Standard\\u2008\\nfor\\u2008Software\\u2008Unit\\u2008Testing.\\n(See sections 2.1.1.,  Unit Testing, and 2.1.2., \\nIntegration Testing, in the Software Testing KA \\nfor more specialized reference material.)\\n3.5. Construction\\u2008for\\u2008Reuse\\n[2*]\\nConstruction for reuse creates software that has \\nthe potential to be reused in the future for the \\npresent project or other projects taking a broad-\\nbased, multisystem perspective. Construction for \\nreuse is usually based on variability analysis and \\ndesign. To avoid the problem of code clones, it \\nis desired to encapsulate reusable code fragments \\ninto well-structured libraries or components.\\nThe tasks related to software construction for \\nreuse during coding and testing are as follows:')),\n",

Construction\\u2008with\\u2008Reuse\\n[2*]\\nConstruction with reuse means to create new \\nsoftware with the reuse of existing software \\nassets. The most popular method of reuse is to \\nreuse code from the libraries provided by the lan-\\nguage, platform, tools being used, or an organiza-\\ntional repository. Asides from these, the applica -\\ntions developed today widely make use of many \\nopen-source libraries. Reused and off-the-shelf \\nsoftware often have the same—or better—quality \\nrequirements as newly developed software (for \\nexample, security level).\\nThe tasks related to software construction with \\nreuse during coding and testing are as follows:\\n• The selection of the reusable units, data -\\nbases, test procedures, or test data.\\n• The evaluation of code or test reusability.\\n• The integration of reusable software assets \\ninto the current software.\\n• The reporting of reuse information on new \\ncode, test procedures, or test data.\\n3.7.\\u2008Construction\\u2008Quality\\n[1*]\\nIn addition to faults resulting from requirements \\nand design, faults introduced during construction \\ncan result in serious quality problems—for exam-\\nple, security vulnerabilities. This includes not \\nonly faults in security functionality but also faults \\nelsewhere that allow bypassing of this functional-\\nity and other security weaknesses or violations.\\nNumerous techniques exist to ensure the qual -\\nity of code as it is constructed. The primary tech-\\nniques used for construction quality include\\n• unit testing and integration testing (see sec -\\ntion 3.4, Construction Testing)\\n• test-first development (see section 2.2 in the \\nSoftware Testing KA)\\n• use of assertions and defensive programming\\n• debugging\\n• inspections\\n• technical reviews, including security-ori -\\nented reviews (see section 2.3.2 in the Soft -\\nware Quality KA)\\n• static analysis (see section 2.3 of the Soft -\\nware Quality KA)\\nThe specific technique or techniques selected \\ndepend on the nature of the software being con -\\nstructed as well as on the skillset of the software \\nengineers performing the construction activi -\\nties. Programmers should know good practices \\nand common vulnerabilities—for example, from \\nwidely recognized lists about common vulner -\\nabilities. Automated static analysis of code for \\nsecurity weaknesses is available for several com-\\nmon programming languages and can be used in \\nsecurity-critical projects.\\nConstruction quality activities are differenti -\\nated from other quality activities by their focus. \\nConstruction quality activities focus on code and \\nartifacts that are closely related to code—such \\nas detailed design—as opposed to other artifacts \\nthat are less directly connected to the code, such \\nas requirements, high-level designs, and plans. \\n3.8.\\u2008Integration\\n[1*]\\nA key activity during construction is the integra -\\ntion of individually constructed routines, classes, \\ncomponents, and subsystems into a single sys -\\ntem. In addition, a particular software system \\nmay need to be integrated with other software or \\nhardware systems.\\nConcerns related to construction integration \\ninclude planning the sequence in which compo -\\nnents will be integrated, identifying what hard -\\nware is needed, creating scaffolding to support \\ninterim versions of the software, determining \\nthe degree of testing and quality work performed \\non components before they are integrated, and ')),\n",

Phased \\nintegration, also called “big bang” integration, \\nentails delaying the integration of component \\nsoftware parts until all parts intended for release \\nin a version are complete. Incremental integration \\nis thought to offer many advantages over the tra -\\nditional phased integration—for example, easier \\nerror location, improved progress monitoring, \\nearlier product delivery, and improved customer \\nrelations. In incremental integration, the develop-\\ners write and test a program in small pieces and \\nthen combine the pieces one at a time. Additional \\ntest infrastructure, such as stubs, drivers, and \\nmock objects, are usually needed to enable incre-\\nmental integration. By building and integrating \\none unit at a time (for example, a class or compo-\\nnent), the construction process can provide early \\nfeedback to developers and customers. Other \\nadvantages of incremental integration include \\neasier error location, improved progress monitor-\\ning, more fully tested units, and so forth.\\n4. Construction Technologies\\n4.1. API\\u2008Design\\u2008and\\u2008Use\\n[3*]\\nAn application programming interface (API) is the \\nset of signatures that are exported and available to \\nthe users of a library or a framework to write their \\napplications. Besides signatures, an API should \\nalways include statements about the program’s \\neffects and/or behaviors (i.e., its semantics).\\nAPI design should try to make the API easy \\nto learn and memorize, lead to readable code, be \\nhard to misuse, be easy to extend, be complete, \\nand maintain backward compatibility. As the \\nAPIs usually outlast their implementations for \\na widely used library or framework, it is desired \\nthat the API be straightforward and kept stable to \\nfacilitate the development and maintenance of the \\nclient applications. \\nAPI use involves the processes of select -\\ning, learning, testing, integrating, and possibly \\nextending APIs provided by a library or frame -\\nwork (see section 3.6, Construction with Reuse).\\n4.2. Object-Oriented\\u2008Runtime\\u2008Issues\\u2008\\n[1*]\\nObject-oriented languages support a series of \\nruntime mechanisms including polymorphism \\nand reflection. These runtime mechanisms \\nincrease the flexibility and adaptability of object-\\noriented programs. Polymorphism is the ability \\nof a language to support general operations with-\\nout knowing until runtime what kind of concrete \\nobjects the software will include. Because the \\nprogram does not know the exact types of the \\nobjects in advance, the exact behaviour is deter -\\nmined at runtime (called dynamic binding).\\nReflection is the ability of a program to observe \\nand modify its own structure and behavior at run-\\ntime. Reflection allows inspection of classes, \\ninterfaces, fields, and methods at runtime with -\\nout knowing their names at compile time. It also \\nallows instantiation at runtime of new objects and \\ninvocation of methods using parameterized class \\nand method names.\\n4.3. Parameterization\\u2008and\\u2008Generics\\n[4*]\\nParameterized types , also known as generics \\n(Ada, Eiffel) and templates (C++), enable the \\ndefinition of a type or class without specifying all \\nthe other types it uses. The unspecified types are \\nsupplied as parameters at the point of use. Param-\\neterized types provide a third way (in addition to \\nclass inheritance and object composition) to com-\\npose behaviors in object-oriented software.\\n4.4. Assertions,\\u2008Design\\u2008by\\u2008Contract,\\u2008and\\u2008Defensive\\u2008\\nProgramming\\n[1*]\\nAn assertion is an executable predicate that’s \\nplaced in a program—usually a routine or macro—\\nthat allows runtime checks of the program. Asser-\\ntions are especially useful in high-reliability pro-\\ngrams. They enable programmers to more quickly \\nflush out mismatched interface assumptions, errors \\nthat creep in when code is modified, and so on. \\nAssertions are normally compiled into the code at \\ndevelopment time and are later compiled out of the \\ncode so that they don’t degrade the performance.')),\n",

When preconditions \\nand postconditions are used, each routine or \\nclass is said to form a contract with the rest of \\nthe program. Furthermore, a contract provides a \\nprecise specification of the semantics of a routine, \\nand thus helps the understanding of its behavior. \\nDesign by contract is thought to improve the \\nquality of software construction.\\nDefensive\\u2008programming means to protect a \\nroutine from being broken by invalid inputs. \\nCommon ways to handle invalid inputs include \\nchecking the values of all the input parameters \\nand deciding how to handle bad inputs.

Error\\u2008Handling,\\u2008Exception\\u2008Handling,\\u2008and\\u2008\\nFault\\u2008Tolerance\\n[1*]\\nThe way that errors are handled affects software’s \\nability to meet requirements related to correct -\\nness, robustness, and other nonfunctional attri -\\nbutes. Assertions are sometimes used to check \\nfor errors. Other error handling techniques—such \\nas returning a neutral value, substituting the next \\npiece of valid data, logging a warning message, \\nreturning an error code, or shutting down the soft-\\nware—are also used.\\nExceptions are used to detect and process \\nerrors or exceptional events. The basic structure \\nof an exception is that a routine uses throw to \\nthrow a detected exception and an exception han-\\ndling block will catch the exception in a try-catch \\nblock. The try-catch block may process the erro -\\nneous condition in the routine or it may return \\ncontrol to the calling routine. Exception handling \\npolicies should be carefully designed follow -\\ning common principles such as including in the \\nexception message all information that led to the \\nexception, avoiding empty catch blocks, knowing \\nthe exceptions the library code throws, perhaps \\nbuilding a centralized exception reporter, and \\nstandardizing the program’s use of exceptions.\\nFault tolerance is a collection of techniques \\nthat increase software reliability by detecting \\nerrors and then recovering from them if possible \\nor containing their effects if recovery is not pos -\\nsible. The most common fault tolerance strategies \\ninclude backing up and retrying, using auxiliary \\ncode, using voting algorithms, and replacing an \\nerroneous value with a phony value that will have \\na benign effect.\\n4.6. Executable\\u2008Models\\u2008\\n[5*]\\nExecutable models abstract away the details of \\nspecific programming languages and decisions \\nabout the organization of the software. Different \\nfrom traditional software models, a specification \\nbuilt in an executable modeling language like \\nxUML (executable UML) can be deployed in \\nvarious software environments without change. \\nAn executable-model compiler (transformer) can \\nturn an executable model into an implementation \\nusing a set of decisions about the target hardware \\nand software environment. Thus, constructing \\nexecutable models can be regarded as a way of \\nconstructing executable software.\\nExecutable models are one foundation support-\\ning the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) initia-\\ntive of the Object Management Group (OMG). An \\nexecutable model is a way to completely specify \\na Platform Independent Model (PIM); a PIM is \\na model of a solution to a problem that does not \\nrely on any implementation technologies. Then \\na Platform Specific Model (PSM), which is a \\nmodel that contains the details of the implemen -\\ntation, can be produced by weaving together the \\nPIM and the platform on which it relies.\\n4.7.\\u2008State-Based\\u2008and\\u2008Table-Driven\\u2008Construction\\u2008\\nTechniques\\n[1*]\\nState-based programming, or automata-based \\nprogramming, is a programming technology \\nusing finite state machines to describe program \\nbehaviours.

The corre -\\nsponding activity, localization, is the activity of \\nmodifying a program to support a specific local \\nlanguage.

It \\ninvolves the creation of a data structure (called a \\nparse\\u2008tree or syntax\\u2008tree) representing the input \\ndata. The inorder traversal of the parse tree usu -\\nally gives the expression just parsed. The parser \\nchecks the symbol table for the presence of \\nprogrammer-defined variables that populate the \\ntree. After building the parse tree, the program \\nuses it as input to the computational processes.\\n4.10.\\u2008Concurrency\\u2008Primitives\\n[7*]\\nA synchronization primitive is a programming \\nabstraction provided by a programming language \\nor the operating system that facilitates concur -\\nrency and synchronization. Well-known concur -\\nrency primitives include semaphores, monitors, \\nand mutexes. \\nA semaphore is a protected variable or abstract \\ndata type that provides a simple but useful abstrac-\\ntion for controlling access to a common resource \\nby multiple processes or threads in a concurrent \\nprogramming environment. \\nA monitor is an abstract data type that presents \\na set of programmer-defined operations that are \\nexecuted with mutual exclusion. A monitor con -\\ntains the declaration of shared variables and pro -\\ncedures or functions that operate on those vari -\\nables. The monitor construct ensures that only \\none process at a time is active within the monitor. \\nA mutex (mutual exclusion) is a synchroniza -\\ntion primitive that grants exclusive access to a \\nshared resource by only one process or thread at \\na time.\\n4.11. Middleware\\n[3*] [6*]\\nMiddleware is a broad classification for soft -\\nware that provides services above the operating \\nsystem layer yet below the application program \\nlayer. Middleware can provide runtime contain -\\ners for software components to provide message \\npassing, persistence, and a transparent location \\nacross a network. Middleware can be viewed as \\na connector between the components that use the \\nmiddleware.

Embedded \\nsystems are typically heterogeneous systems.\\nThe design of heterogeneous systems may \\nrequire the combination of several specification \\nlanguages in order to design different parts of \\nthe system—in other words, hardware/software \\ncodesign. The key issues include multilanguage \\nvalidation, cosimulation, and interfacing.\\nDuring the hardware/software codesign, soft -\\nware development and virtual hardware devel -\\nopment proceed concurrently through stepwise \\ndecomposition. The hardware part is usually \\nsimulated in field programmable gate arrays \\n(FPGAs) or application-specific integrated cir -\\ncuits (ASICs).

Performance analysis is the inves-\\ntigation of a program’s behavior using informa -\\ntion gathered as the program executes, with the \\ngoal of identifying possible hot spots in the pro -\\ngram to be improved.\\nCode tuning, which improves performance at \\nthe code level, is the practice of modifying correct \\ncode in ways that make it run more efficiently. \\nCode tuning usually involves only small-scale \\nchanges that affect a single class, a single routine, \\nor, more commonly, a few lines of code. A rich \\nset of code tuning techniques is available, includ-\\ning those for tuning logic expressions, loops, data \\ntransformations, expressions, and routines.

GUI\\u2008Builders\\n[1*]\\nA GUI (Graphical User Interface) builder is a \\nsoftware development tool that enables the devel-\\noper to create and maintain GUIs in a WYSI -\\nWYG (what you see is what you get) mode. A \\nGUI builder usually includes a visual editor \\nfor the developer to design forms and windows \\nand manage the layout of the widgets by drag -\\nging, dropping, and parameter setting. Some GUI \\nbuilders can automatically generate the source \\ncode corresponding to the visual GUI design.\\nBecause current GUI applications usually fol -\\nlow the event-driven style (in which the flow of \\nthe program is determined by events and event \\nhandling), GUI builder tools usually provide \\ncode generation assistants, which automate the \\nmost repetitive tasks required for event handling. \\nThe supporting code connects widgets with the \\noutgoing and incoming events that trigger the \\nfunctions providing the application logic.\\nSome modern IDEs provide integrated GUI \\nbuilders or GUI builder plug-ins.

Unit testing is often auto-\\nmated. Developers can use unit testing tools \\nand frameworks to extend and create automated \\ntesting environment. With unit testing tools and \\nframeworks, the developer can code criteria into \\nthe test to verify the unit’s correctness under vari-\\nous data sets. Each individual test is implemented \\nas an object, and a test runner runs all of the tests. \\nDuring the test execution, those failed test cases \\nwill be automatically flagged and reported.\\n5.4.

An \\nexecution profiling tool monitors the code while \\nit runs and records how many times each state -\\nment is executed or how much time the program \\nspends on each statement or execution path. Pro-\\nfiling the code while it is running gives insight \\ninto how the program works, where the hot spots \\nare, and where the developers should focus the \\ncode tuning efforts.\\nProgram slicing involves computation of the \\nset of program statements (i.e., the program slice) \\nthat may affect the values of specified variables \\nat some point of interest, which is referred to as \\na slicing criterion.

To be precise, the input \\nvalue alone is not always sufficient to spec -\\nify a test, since a complex, nondeterministic \\nsystem might react to the same input with \\ndifferent behaviors, depending on the system \\nstate. In this KA, however, the term “input” \\nwill be maintained, with the implied conven-\\ntion that its meaning also includes a speci -\\nfied input state in those cases for which it \\nis important. Static techniques are different \\nfrom and complementary to dynamic testing. \\nStatic techniques are covered in the Software \\nQuality KA. It is worth noting that terminol-\\nogy is not uniform among different commu -\\nnities and some use the term “testing” also in \\nreference to static techniques. \\n• Finite: Even in simple programs, so many test \\ncases are theoretically possible that exhaus -\\ntive testing could require months or years to \\nexecute. This is why, in practice, a complete \\nset of tests can generally be considered infi -\\nnite, and testing is conducted on a subset of \\nall possible tests, which is determined by risk \\nand prioritization criteria. Testing always \\nimplies a tradeoff between limited resources \\nand schedules on the one hand and inherently \\nunlimited test requirements on the other.\\n• Selected: The many proposed test tech -\\nniques differ essentially in how the test set \\nis selected, and software engineers must be \\naware that different selection criteria may \\nyield vastly different degrees of effective -\\nness. How to identify the most suitable \\nselection criterion under given conditions is \\na complex problem; in practice, risk analysis \\ntechniques and software engineering exper -\\ntise are applied.\\n• Expected: It must be possible, although not \\nalways easy, to decide whether the observed \\noutcomes of program testing are acceptable \\nor not; otherwise, the testing effort is use -\\nless. The observed behavior may be checked \\nagainst user needs (commonly referred to \\nas testing for validation), against a speci -\\nfication (testing for verification), or, per -\\nhaps, against the anticipated behavior from \\nimplicit requirements or expectations (see \\nAcceptance Tests in the Software Require -\\nments KA). \\nIn recent years, the view of software testing \\nhas matured into a constructive one. Testing is \\nno longer seen as an activity that starts only after \\nthe coding phase is complete with the limited \\npurpose of detecting failures. Software testing \\nis, or should be, pervasive throughout the entire \\ndevelopment and maintenance life cycle. Indeed, \\nplanning for software testing should start with the \\nearly stages of the software requirements process, ')),\n",

Testing can be seen, then, as a means for \\nproviding information about the functionality \\nand quality attributes of the software and also \\nfor identifying faults in those cases where error \\nprevention has not been effective. It is perhaps \\nobvious but worth recognizing that software can \\nstill contain faults, even after completion of an \\nextensive testing activity. Software failures expe-\\nrienced after delivery are addressed by corrective \\nmaintenance. Software maintenance topics are \\ncovered in the Software Maintenance KA.\\nIn the Software Quality KA (see Software Qual-\\nity Management Techniques), software quality \\nmanagement techniques are notably categorized \\ninto static techniques (no code execution) and \\nFigure 4.1.

Both cat -\\negories are useful. This KA focuses on dynamic \\ntechniques.\\nSoftware testing is also related to software \\nconstruction (see Construction Testing in the \\nSoftware Construction KA). In particular, unit \\nand integration testing are intimately related to \\nsoftware construction, if not part of it.\\nBREAKDOWN OF TOPICS FOR \\nSOFTWARE TESTING \\nThe breakdown of topics for the Software Test -\\ning KA is shown in Figure 4.1. A more detailed \\nbreakdown is provided in the Matrix of Topics \\nvs. Reference Material at the end of this KA.\\nThe first topic describes Software Testing Fun-\\ndamentals. It covers the basic definitions in the \\nfield of software testing, the basic terminology \\nand key issues, and software testing’s relation -\\nship with other activities.\\nThe second topic, Test Levels, consists of two \\n(orthogonal) subtopics: the first subtopic lists the \\nlevels in which the testing of large software is \\ntraditionally subdivided, and the second subtopic \\nconsiders testing for specific conditions or prop -\\nerties and is referred to as Objectives of Testing. \\nNot all types of testing apply to every software \\nproduct, nor has every possible type been listed.\\nThe test target and test objective together \\ndetermine how the test set is identified, both with \\nregard to its consistency— how\\u2008much\\u2008testing\\u2008is\\u2008\\nenough\\u2008for\\u2008achieving\\u2008the\\u2008stated\\u2008objective—and \\nto its composition— which\\u2008 test\\u2008 cases\\u2008 should\\u2008\\nbe\\u2008selected\\u2008for\\u2008achieving\\u2008the\\u2008stated\\u2008objective \\n(although usually “for achieving the stated objec-\\ntive” remains implicit and only the first part of the \\ntwo italicized questions above is posed). Criteria \\nfor addressing the first question are referred to as \\ntest\\u2008adequacy criteria, while those addressing the \\nsecond question are the test selection\\u2008criteria.\\nSeveral Test Techniques have been developed \\nin the past few decades, and new ones are still \\nbeing proposed. Generally accepted techniques \\nare covered in the third topic.\\nTest-Related Measures are dealt with in the \\nfourth topic, while the issues relative to Test Pro-\\ncess are covered in the fifth. Finally, Software \\nTesting Tools are presented in topic six.\\n1. Software Testing Fundamentals\\n1.1. Testing-Related\\u2008Terminology\\n1.1.1. Definitions\\u2008of\\u2008Testing\\u2008and\\u2008Related\\u2008\\nTerminology\\u2008\\n[1*, c1, c2] [2*, c8]\\nDefinitions of testing and testing-related termi -\\nnology are provided in the cited references and \\nsummarized as follows. \\n1.1.2. Faults\\u2008vs.\\u2008Failures\\u2008\\n[1*, c1s5] [2*, c11]\\nMany terms are used in the software engineering \\nliterature to describe a malfunction: notably fault, \\nfailure, and error, among others. This terminol -\\nogy is precisely defined in [3, c2]. It is essential \\nto clearly distinguish between the cause of a mal-\\nfunction (for which the term fault will be used \\nhere) and an undesired effect observed in the sys-\\ntem’s delivered service (which will be called a \\nfailure). Indeed there may well be faults in the \\nsoftware that never manifest themselves as fail -\\nures (see Theoretical and Practical Limitations \\nof Testing in section 1.2, Key Issues). Thus test -\\ning can reveal failures, but it is the faults that can \\nand must be removed [3]. The more generic term \\ndefect can be used to refer to either a fault or a \\nfailure, when the distinction is not important [3].\\nHowever, it should be recognized that the cause \\nof a failure cannot always be unequivocally iden-\\ntified. No theoretical criteria exist to definitively \\ndetermine, in general, the fault that caused an \\nobserved failure. It might be said that it was the \\nfault that had to be modified to remove the failure, \\nbut other modifications might have worked just \\nas well. To avoid ambiguity, one could refer to \\nfailure-causing\\u2008inputs instead of faults—that is, \\nthose sets of inputs that cause a failure to appear.\\n1.2. Key\\u2008Issues\\n1.2.1.

Test ade -\\nquacy criteria can be used to decide when suf -\\nficient testing will be, or has been accomplished \\n[4] (see Termination in section 5.1, Practical \\nConsiderations).\\n1.2.2. Testing\\u2008Effectiveness\\u2008/\\u2008Objectives\\u2008for\\u2008\\nTesting\\u2008\\n[1*, c11s4, c13s11]\\nTesting effectiveness is determined by analyzing \\na set of program executions. Selection of tests to \\nbe executed can be guided by different objectives: \\nit is only in light of the objective pursued that the \\neffectiveness of the test set can be evaluated. \\n1.2.3. Testing\\u2008for\\u2008Defect\\u2008Discovery\\u2008\\n[1*, c1s14]\\nIn testing for defect discovery, a successful test \\nis one that causes the system to fail. This is quite \\ndifferent from testing to demonstrate that the \\nsoftware meets its specifications or other desired \\nproperties, in which case testing is successful if \\nno failures are observed under realistic test cases \\nand test environments.\\n1.2.4. The\\u2008Oracle\\u2008Problem\\u2008\\n[1*, c1s9, c9s7]\\nAn oracle is any human or mechanical agent that \\ndecides whether a program behaved correctly \\nin a given test and accordingly results in a ver -\\ndict of “pass” or “fail.” There exist many differ -\\nent kinds of oracles; for example, unambiguous \\nrequirements specifications, behavioral models, \\nand code annotations. Automation of mechanized \\noracles can be difficult and expensive. \\n1.2.5. Theoretical\\u2008and\\u2008Practical\\u2008Limitations\\u2008of\\u2008\\nTesting\\u2008\\n[1*, c2s7]\\nTesting theory warns against ascribing an unjusti-\\nfied level of confidence to a series of successful \\ntests. Unfortunately, most established results of \\ntesting theory are negative ones, in that they state \\nwhat testing can never achieve as opposed to what \\nis actually achieved. The most famous quotation \\nin this regard is the Dijkstra aphorism that “pro -\\ngram testing can be used to show the presence of \\nbugs, but never to show their absence” [5]. The \\nobvious reason for this is that complete testing is \\nnot feasible in realistic software. Because of this, \\ntesting must be driven  based on risk [6, part 1] \\nand can be seen as a risk management strategy.\\n1.2.6. The\\u2008Problem\\u2008of\\u2008Infeasible\\u2008Paths\\u2008\\n[1*, c4s7]\\nInfeasible paths are control flow paths that cannot \\nbe exercised by any input data. They are a signifi-\\ncant problem in path-based testing, particularly \\nin automated derivation of test inputs to exercise \\ncontrol flow paths.\\n1.2.7.\\u2008Testability\\u2008\\n[1*, c17s2]\\nThe term “software testability” has two related \\nbut different meanings: on the one hand, it refers \\nto the ease with which a given test coverage \\ncriterion can be satisfied; on the other hand, it \\nis defined as the likelihood, possibly measured \\nstatistically, that a set of test cases will expose \\na failure if the software is faulty. Both meanings \\nare important.\\n1.3. Relationship\\u2008of\\u2008Testing\\u2008to\\u2008Other\\u2008Activities\\nSoftware testing is related to, but different from, \\nstatic software quality management techniques , \\nproofs of correctness, debugging, and program \\nconstruction. However, it is informative to con -\\nsider testing from the point of view of software \\nquality analysts and of certifiers.\\n• Testing vs. Static Software Quality Man -\\nagement Techniques (see Software Quality \\nManagement Techniques in the Software \\nQuality KA [1*, c12]). \\n• Testing vs. Correctness Proofs and Formal \\nVerification (see the Software Engineering \\nModels and Methods KA [1*, c17s2]).\\n• Testing vs. Debugging (see Construction \\nTesting in the Software Construction KA \\nand Debugging Tools and Techniques in the \\nComputing Foundations KA [1*, c3s6]).')),\n",

Test Levels\\nSoftware testing is usually performed at differ -\\nent levels throughout the development and main-\\ntenance processes. Levels can be distinguished \\nbased on the object of testing, which is called \\nthe target, or on the purpose, which is called the \\nobjective (of the test level). \\n2.1. The\\u2008Target\\u2008of\\u2008the\\u2008Test\\u2008\\n[1*, c1s13] [2*, c8s1]\\nThe target of the test can vary: a single module, a \\ngroup of such modules (related by purpose, use, \\nbehavior, or structure), or an entire system. Three \\ntest stages can be distinguished: unit, integra -\\ntion, and system. These three test stages do not \\nimply any process model, nor is any one of them \\nassumed to be more important than the other two. \\n2.1.1. Unit\\u2008Testing\\u2008\\n[1*, c3] [2*, c8] \\nUnit testing verifies the functioning in isolation \\nof software elements that are separately testable. \\nDepending on the context, these could be the \\nindividual subprograms or a larger component \\nmade of highly cohesive units. Typically, unit \\ntesting occurs with access to the code being tested \\nand with the support of debugging tools. The pro-\\ngrammers who wrote the code typically, but not \\nalways, conduct unit testing. \\n2.1.2. Integration\\u2008Testing\\u2008\\n[1*, c7] [2*, c8]\\nIntegration testing is the process of verifying the \\ninteractions among software components. Clas -\\nsical integration testing strategies, such as top-\\ndown and bottom-up, are often used with hierar -\\nchically structured software. \\nModern, systematic integration strategies are \\ntypically architecture-driven, which involves \\nincrementally integrating the software com -\\nponents or subsystems based on identified \\nfunctional threads. Integration testing is often an \\nongoing activity at each stage of development \\nduring which software engineers abstract away \\nlower-level perspectives and concentrate on the \\nperspectives of the level at which they are inte -\\ngrating. For other than small, simple software, \\nincremental integration testing strategies are usu-\\nally preferred to putting all of the components \\ntogether at once—which is often called “big \\nbang” testing.\\n2.1.3. System\\u2008Testing\\u2008\\n[1*, c8] [2*, c8]\\nSystem testing is concerned with testing the \\nbehavior of an entire system. Effective unit and \\nintegration testing will have identified many of \\nthe software defects. System testing is usually \\nconsidered appropriate for assessing the non -\\nfunctional system requirements—such as secu -\\nrity, speed, accuracy, and reliability (see Func -\\ntional and Non-Functional Requirements in the \\nSoftware Requirements KA and Software Qual -\\nity Requirements in the Software Quality KA). \\nExternal interfaces to other applications, utilities, \\nhardware devices, or the operating environments \\nare also usually evaluated at this level. \\n2.2. Objectives\\u2008of\\u2008Testing\\u2008\\n[1*, c1s7]\\nTesting is conducted in view of specific objec -\\ntives, which are stated more or less explicitly \\nand with varying degrees of precision. Stating \\nthe objectives of testing in precise, quantitative \\nterms supports measurement and control of the \\ntest process.\\nTesting can be aimed at verifying different prop-\\nerties. Test cases can be designed to check that \\nthe functional specifications are correctly imple -\\nmented, which is variously referred to in the lit -\\nerature as conformance testing, correctness test -\\ning, or functional testing. However, several other \\nnonfunctional properties may be tested as well—\\nincluding performance, reliability, and usabil -\\nity, among many others (see Models and Quality \\nCharacteristics in the Software Quality KA).\\nOther important objectives for testing include \\nbut are not limited to reliability measurement, ')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 86}, page_content='4-6 SWEBOK® Guide V3.0\\nidentification of security vulnerabilities, usability \\nevaluation, and software acceptance, for which \\ndifferent approaches would be taken. Note that, \\nin general, the test objectives vary with the test \\ntarget; different purposes are addressed at differ -\\nent levels of testing.\\nThe subtopics listed below are those most \\noften cited in the literature. Note that some kinds \\nof testing are more appropriate for custom-made \\nsoftware packages—installation  testing, for \\nexample—and others for consumer products, like \\nbeta testing.\\n2.2.1. Acceptance\\u2008/\\u2008Qualification\\u2008Testing\\u2008\\n[1*, c1s7] [2*, c8s4]\\nAcceptance / qualification testing determines \\nwhether a system satisfies its acceptance criteria, \\nusually by checking desired system behaviors \\nagainst the customer’s requirements. The cus -\\ntomer or a customer’s representative thus speci -\\nfies or directly undertakes activities to check \\nthat their requirements have been met, or in the \\ncase of a consumer product, that the organization \\nhas satisfied the stated requirements for the tar -\\nget market. This testing activity may or may not \\ninvolve the developers of the system.\\n2.2.2. Installation\\u2008Testing\\u2008\\n[1*, c12s2]\\nOften, after completion of system and acceptance \\ntesting, the software is verified upon installation \\nin the target environment. Installation testing can \\nbe viewed as system testing conducted in the \\noperational environment of hardware configura -\\ntions and other operational constraints. Installa -\\ntion procedures may also be verified.\\n2.2.3. Alpha\\u2008and\\u2008Beta\\u2008Testing\\u2008\\n[1*, c13s7, c16s6] [2*, c8s4]\\nBefore software is released, it is sometimes given \\nto a small, selected group of potential users for \\ntrial use ( alpha\\u2008testing) and/or to a larger set of \\nrepresentative users ( beta\\u2008testing). These users \\nreport problems with the product. Alpha and beta \\ntesting are often uncontrolled and are not always \\nreferred to in a test plan.\\n2.2.4. Reliability\\u2008Achievement\\u2008and\\u2008Evaluation\\u2008\\n[1*, c15] [2*, c15s2]\\nTesting improves reliability by identifying and \\ncorrecting faults. In addition, statistical measures \\nof reliability can be derived by randomly generat-\\ning test cases according to the operational profile of \\nthe software (see Operational Profile in section 3.5, \\nUsage-Based Techniques). The latter approach is \\ncalled operational\\u2008testing. Using reliability growth \\nmodels, both objectives can be pursued together \\n[3] (see Life Test, Reliability Evaluation in section \\n4.1, Evaluation of the Program under Test).\\n2.2.5. Regression\\u2008Testing\\u2008\\n[1*, c8s11, c13s3]\\nAccording to [7], regression testing is the “selec-\\ntive retesting of a system or component to verify \\nthat modifications have not caused unintended \\neffects and that the system or component still \\ncomplies with its specified requirements.” In \\npractice, the approach is to show that software \\nstill passes previously passed tests in a test suite \\n(in fact, it is also sometimes referred to as nonre-\\ngression testing). For incremental development, \\nthe purpose of regression testing is to show that \\nsoftware behavior is unchanged by incremen -\\ntal changes to the software, except insofar as it \\nshould. In some cases, a tradeoff must be made \\nbetween the assurance given by regression testing \\nevery time a change is made and the resources \\nrequired to perform the regression tests, which \\ncan be quite time consuming due to the large \\nnumber of tests that may be executed. Regression \\ntesting involves selecting, minimizing, and/or \\nprioritizing a subset of the test cases in an exist -\\ning test suite [8].

Usually the test cases are generated from \\nthe interface specification. A specific objective of \\ninterface testing is to simulate the use of APIs by \\nend-user applications.

In \\ngeneral, it may involve testing the software func-\\ntions that supports user tasks, documentation that \\naids users, and the ability of the system to recover \\nfrom user errors (see User Interface Design in the \\nSoftware Design KA). \\n3. Test Techniques\\nOne of the aims of testing is to detect as many \\nfailures as possible. Many techniques have been \\ndeveloped to do this [6, part 4]. These techniques \\nattempt to “break” a program by being as sys -\\ntematic as possible in identifying inputs that will \\nproduce representative program behaviors; for \\ninstance, by considering subclasses of the input \\ndomain, scenarios, states, and data flows. \\nThe classification of testing techniques pre -\\nsented here is based on how tests are generated: \\nfrom the software engineer’s intuition and expe -\\nrience, the specifications, the code structure, the \\nreal or imagined faults to be discovered, predicted \\nusage, models, or the nature of the application. \\nOne category deals with the combined use of two \\nor more techniques.\\nSometimes these techniques are classified as \\nwhite-box (also called glass-box), if the tests are \\nbased on information about how the software has \\nbeen designed or coded, or as black-box if the test \\ncases rely only on the input/output behavior of \\nthe software.

Ad\\u2008Hoc\\nPerhaps the most widely practiced technique is \\nad hoc testing: tests are derived relying on the \\nsoftware engineer’s skill, intuition, and experi -\\nence with similar programs. Ad hoc testing can \\nbe useful for identifying tests cases that not easily \\ngenerated by more formalized techniques. \\n3.1.2. Exploratory\\u2008Testing\\nExploratory testing is defined as simultaneous \\nlearning, test design, and test execution [6, part \\n1]; that is, the tests are not defined in advance \\nin an established test plan, but are dynamically \\ndesigned, executed, and modified. The effective -\\nness of exploratory testing relies on the software \\nengineer’s knowledge, which can be derived \\nfrom various sources: observed product behavior \\nduring testing, familiarity with the application, \\nthe platform, the failure process, the type of pos -\\nsible faults and failures, the risk associated with a \\nparticular product, and so on.\\n3.2. Input\\u2008Domain-Based\\u2008Techniques\\n3.2.1. Equivalence\\u2008Partitioning\\u2008\\n[1*, c9s4]\\nEquivalence partitioning involves partitioning the \\ninput domain into a collection of subsets (or equiv-\\nalent classes) based on a specified criterion or rela-\\ntion. This criterion or relation may be different \\ncomputational results, a relation based on control \\nflow or data flow, or a distinction made between \\nvalid inputs that are accepted and processed by the \\nsystem and invalid inputs, such as out of range val-\\nues, that are not accepted and should generate an \\nerror message or initiate error processing. A repre-\\nsentative set of tests (sometimes only one) is usu-\\nally taken from each equivalency class.\\n3.2.2. Pairwise\\u2008Testing\\u2008\\n[1*, c9s3]\\nTest cases are derived by combining interesting \\nvalues for every pair of a set of input variables \\ninstead of considering all possible combinations. \\nPairwise testing belongs to combinatorial testing, \\nwhich in general also includes higher-level com -\\nbinations than pairs: these techniques are referred \\nto as t-wise, whereby every possible combination \\nof\\u2008t input variables is considered.\\n3.2.3. Boundary-Value\\u2008Analysis\\u2008\\n[1*, c9s5]\\nTest cases are chosen on or near the boundaries of \\nthe input domain of variables, with the underly -\\ning rationale that many faults tend to concentrate \\nnear the extreme values of inputs. An extension of \\nthis technique is robustness testing, wherein test \\ncases are also chosen outside the input domain of \\nvariables to test program robustness in processing \\nunexpected or erroneous inputs. \\n3.2.4. Random\\u2008Testing\\u2008\\n[1*, c9s7]\\nTests are generated purely at random (not to be \\nconfused with statistical testing from the opera -\\ntional profile, as described in Operational Profile \\nin section 3.5). This form of testing falls under the \\nheading of input domain testing since the input \\ndomain must be known in order to be able to pick \\nrandom points within it. Random testing provides \\na relatively simple approach for test automation; \\nrecently, enhanced forms of random testing have \\nbeen proposed in which the random input sam -\\npling is directed by other input selection criteria \\n[11]. Fuzz testing or fuzzing is a special form of \\nrandom testing aimed at breaking the software; it \\nis most often used for security testing.\\n3.3. Code-Based\\u2008Techniques\\n3.3.1. Control\\u2008Flow-Based\\u2008Criteria\\u2008\\n[1*, c4]\\nControl flow-based coverage criteria are aimed \\nat covering all the statements, blocks of state -\\nments, or specified combinations of statements \\nin a program. The strongest of the control flow-\\nbased criteria is path testing, which aims to \\nexecute all entry-to-exit control flow paths in a \\nprogram’s control flow graph. Since exhaustive \\npath testing is generally not feasible because of ')),\n",

The adequacy of such \\ntests is measured in percentages; for example, \\nwhen all branches have been executed at least \\nonce by the tests, 100% branch coverage has \\nbeen achieved.\\n3.3.2. Data\\u2008Flow-Based\\u2008Criteria\\u2008\\n[1*, c5]\\nIn data flow-based testing, the control flow graph \\nis annotated with information about how the \\nprogram variables are defined, used, and killed \\n(undefined). The strongest criterion, all defini -\\ntion-use paths, requires that, for each variable, \\nevery control flow path segment from a defini -\\ntion of that variable to a use of that definition is \\nexecuted. In order to reduce the number of paths \\nrequired, weaker strategies such as all-definitions \\nand all-uses are employed.\\n3.3.3. Reference\\u2008Models\\u2008for\\u2008Code-Based\\u2008\\nTesting\\n[1*, c4]\\nAlthough not a technique in itself, the control \\nstructure of a program can be graphically rep -\\nresented using a flow graph to visualize code-\\nbased testing techniques. A flow graph is a \\ndirected graph, the nodes and arcs of which cor -\\nrespond to program elements (see Graphs and \\nTrees in the Mathematical Foundations KA). \\nFor instance, nodes may represent statements or \\nuninterrupted sequences of statements, and arcs \\nmay represent the transfer of control between \\nnodes.\\n3.4. Fault-Based\\u2008Techniques\\u2008\\n[1*, c1s14]\\nWith different degrees of formalization, fault-\\nbased testing techniques devise test cases spe -\\ncifically aimed at revealing categories of likely \\nor predefined faults. To better focus the test case \\ngeneration or selection, a fault\\u2008model can be \\nintroduced that classifies the different types of \\nfaults. \\n3.4.1. Error\\u2008Guessing\\u2008\\n[1*, c9s8]\\nIn error guessing, test cases are specifically \\ndesigned by software engineers who try to antici-\\npate the most plausible faults in a given program. \\nA good source of information is the history of \\nfaults discovered in earlier projects, as well as the \\nsoftware engineer’s expertise.\\n3.4.2. Mutation\\u2008Testing\\u2008\\n[1*, c3s5]\\nA mutant is a slightly modified version of the \\nprogram under test, differing from it by a small \\nsyntactic change. Every test case exercises both \\nthe original program and all generated mutants: \\nif a test case is successful in identifying the dif -\\nference between the program and a mutant, the \\nlatter is said to be “killed.” Originally conceived \\nas a technique to evaluate test sets (see section \\n4.2. Evaluation of the Tests Performed), muta -\\ntion testing is also a testing criterion in itself: \\neither tests are randomly generated until enough \\nmutants have been killed, or tests are specifically \\ndesigned to kill surviving mutants. In the latter \\ncase, mutation testing can also be categorized as \\na code-based technique. The underlying assump-\\ntion of mutation testing, the coupling effect, \\nis that by looking for simple syntactic faults, \\nmore complex but real faults will be found. For \\nthe technique to be effective, a large number of \\nmutants must be automatically generated and \\nexecuted in a systematic way [12].\\n3.5. Usage-Based\\u2008Techniques\\n3.5.1. Operational\\u2008Profile\\u2008\\n[1*, c15s5]\\nIn testing for reliability evaluation (also called \\noperational testing), the test environment repro -\\nduces the operational environment of the soft -\\nware, or the operational\\u2008profile, as closely as \\npossible. The goal is to infer from the observed \\ntest results the future reliability of the software \\nwhen in actual use. To do this, inputs are assigned \\nprobabilities, or profiles, according to their fre -\\nquency of occurrence in actual operation. Opera-\\ntional profiles can be used during system testing ')),\n",

User\\u2008Observation\\u2008Heuristics\\u2008\\n[10*, c5, c7]\\nUsability principles can provide guidelines for dis-\\ncovering problems in the design of the user inter-\\nface [10*, c1s4] (see User Interface Design in the \\nSoftware Design KA). Specialized heuristics, also \\ncalled usability inspection methods, are applied \\nfor the systematic observation of system usage \\nunder controlled conditions in order to deter -\\nmine how well people can use the system and its \\ninterfaces. Usability heuristics include cognitive \\nwalkthroughs, claims analysis, field observations, \\nthinking aloud, and even indirect approaches such \\nas user questionnaires and interviews. \\n3.6. Model-Based\\u2008Testing\\u2008Techniques\\nA model in this context is an abstract (formal) \\nrepresentation of the software under test or of \\nits software requirements (see Modeling in the \\nSoftware Engineering Models and Methods KA). \\nModel-based testing is used to validate require -\\nments, check their consistency, and generate test \\ncases focused on the behavioral aspects of the \\nsoftware. The key components of model-based \\ntesting are [13]: the notation used to represent the \\nmodel of the software or its requirements; work -\\nflow models or similar models; the test strategy \\nor algorithm used for test case generation; the \\nsupporting infrastructure for the test execution; \\nand the evaluation of test results compared to \\nexpected results. Due to the complexity of the \\ntechniques, model-based testing approaches \\nare often used in conjunction with test automa -\\ntion harnesses. Model-based testing techniques \\ninclude the following.\\n3.6.1. Decision\\u2008Tables\\u2008\\n[1*, c9s6]\\nDecision tables represent logical relationships \\nbetween conditions (roughly, inputs) and actions \\n(roughly, outputs).

The notation was conceived for the specific \\nneeds of testing telecommunication systems, so it \\nis particularly suitable for testing complex com -\\nmunication protocols. \\n3.6.4. Workflow\\u2008Models\\u2008\\n[2*, c8s3.2, c19s3.1]\\nWorkflow models specify a sequence of activi -\\nties performed by humans and/or software appli -\\ncations, usually represented through graphical \\nnotations.

Test-Related Measures\\nSometimes testing techniques are confused with \\ntesting objectives. Testing techniques can be \\nviewed as aids that help to ensure the achieve -\\nment of test objectives [6, part 4]. For instance, \\nbranch coverage is a popular testing technique. \\nAchieving a specified branch coverage measure \\n(e.g., 95% branch coverage) should not be the \\nobjective of testing per se: it is a way of improv -\\ning the chances of finding failures by attempting \\nto systematically exercise every program branch \\nat every decision point. To avoid such misun -\\nderstandings, a clear distinction should be made \\nbetween test-related measures that provide an \\nevaluation of the program under test, based on \\nthe observed test outputs, and the measures that \\nevaluate the thoroughness of the test set. (See \\nSoftware Engineering Measurement in the Soft -\\nware Engineering Management KA for informa -\\ntion on measurement programs. See Software \\nProcess and Product Measurement in the Soft -\\nware Engineering Process KA for information on \\nmeasures.)\\nMeasurement is usually considered fundamen-\\ntal to quality analysis. Measurement may also be \\nused to optimize the planning and execution of \\nthe tests. Test management can use several differ-\\nent process measures to monitor progress.

To evaluate the \\nthoroughness of the executed tests, software engi-\\nneers can monitor the elements covered so that \\nthey can dynamically measure the ratio between \\ncovered elements and the total number. For exam-\\nple, it is possible to measure the percentage of \\nbranches covered in the program flow graph or the \\npercentage of functional requirements exercised \\namong those listed in the specifications document. \\nCode-based adequacy criteria require appropriate \\ninstrumentation of the program under test.\\n4.2.2. Fault\\u2008Seeding\\u2008\\n[1*, c2s5] [9*, c6]\\nIn fault seeding, some faults are artificially intro-\\nduced into a program before testing. When the \\ntests are executed, some of these seeded faults will \\nbe revealed as well as, possibly, some faults that \\nwere already there. In theory, depending on which \\nand how many of the artificial faults are discov -\\nered, testing effectiveness can be evaluated and the \\nremaining number of genuine faults can be esti -\\nmated. In practice, statisticians question the dis -\\ntribution and representativeness of seeded faults \\nrelative to genuine faults and the small sample size \\non which any extrapolations are based.

Possible inter-\\npretations include the number of tests needed to \\nfind the first failure, the ratio of the number of \\nfaults found through testing to all the faults found \\nduring and after testing, and how much reliabil -\\nity was improved.

Such an evaluation can be associated \\nwith the analysis of risks. Moreover, the resources \\nthat are worth spending on testing should be com-\\nmensurate with the use/criticality of the applica -\\ntion: different techniques have different costs and \\nyield different levels of confidence in product \\nreliability.\\n5.1.8.\\u2008Termination\\u2008\\n[9*, c10s4]\\nA decision must be made as to how much test -\\ning is enough and when a test stage can be termi-\\nnated. Thoroughness measures, such as achieved \\ncode coverage or functional coverage, as well as \\nestimates of fault density or of operational reli -\\nability, provide useful support but are not suffi -\\ncient in themselves. The decision also involves \\nconsiderations about the costs and risks incurred \\nby possible remaining failures, as opposed to \\nthe costs incurred by continuing to test (see Test \\nSelection Criteria / Test Adequacy Criteria in \\nsection 1.2, Key Issues).\\n5.1.9.\\u2008Test\\u2008Reuse\\u2008and\\u2008Test\\u2008Patterns\\u2008\\n[9*, c2s5]\\nTo carry out testing or maintenance in an orga -\\nnized and cost-effective way, the means used to \\ntest each part of the software should be reused \\nsystematically. A repository of test materials \\nshould be under the control of software con -\\nfiguration management so that changes to soft -\\nware requirements or design can be reflected in \\nchanges to the tests conducted.\\nThe test solutions adopted for testing some \\napplication types under certain circumstances, \\nwith the motivations behind the decisions taken, \\nform a test pattern that can itself be documented \\nfor later reuse in similar projects.\\n5.2. Test\\u2008Activities\\nAs shown in the following description, successful \\nmanagement of test activities strongly depends \\non the software configuration management pro -\\ncess (see the Software Configuration Manage -\\nment KA).\\n5.2.1. Planning\\u2008\\n[1*, c12s1, c12s8] \\nLike all other aspects of project management, \\ntesting activities must be planned. Key aspects \\nof test planning include coordination of person -\\nnel, availability of test facilities and equipment, \\ncreation and maintenance of all test-related docu-\\nmentation, and planning for possible undesir -\\nable outcomes. If more than one baseline of the \\nsoftware is being maintained, then a major plan -\\nning consideration is the time and effort needed \\nto ensure that the test environment is set to the \\nproper configuration.\\n5.2.2. Test-Case\\u2008Generation\\u2008\\n[1*, c12s1, c12s3]\\nGeneration of test cases is based on the level of \\ntesting to be performed and the particular testing \\ntechniques. Test cases should be under the con -\\ntrol of software configuration management and \\ninclude the expected results for each test.\\n5.2.3. Test\\u2008Environment\\u2008Development\\u2008\\n[1*, c12s6]\\nThe environment used for testing should be com-\\npatible with the other adopted software engi -\\nneering tools. It should facilitate development \\nand control of test cases, as well as logging and \\nrecovery of expected results, scripts, and other \\ntesting materials.\\n5.2.4. Execution\\u2008\\n[1*, c12s7]\\nExecution of tests should embody a basic prin -\\nciple of scientific experimentation: everything \\ndone during testing should be performed and \\ndocumented clearly enough that another person ')),\n",

Hence, testing should \\nbe performed in accordance with documented \\nprocedures using a clearly defined version of the \\nsoftware under test.\\n5.2.5. Test\\u2008Results\\u2008Evaluation\\u2008\\n[9*, c15]\\nThe results of testing should be evaluated to \\ndetermine whether or not the testing has been \\nsuccessful. In most cases, “successful” means \\nthat the software performed as expected and did \\nnot have any major unexpected outcomes. Not \\nall unexpected outcomes are necessarily faults \\nbut are sometime determined to be simply noise. \\nBefore a fault can be removed, an analysis and \\ndebugging effort is needed to isolate, identify, \\nand describe it. When test results are particularly \\nimportant, a formal review board may be con -\\nvened to evaluate them.\\n5.2.6. Problem\\u2008Reporting\\u2008/\\u2008Test\\u2008Log\\u2008\\n[1*, c13s9]\\nTesting activities can be entered into a testing \\nlog to identify when a test was conducted, who \\nperformed the test, what software configuration \\nwas used, and other relevant identification infor -\\nmation. Unexpected or incorrect test results can \\nbe recorded in a problem reporting system, the \\ndata for which forms the basis for later debug -\\nging and fixing the problems that were observed \\nas failures during testing. Also, anomalies not \\nclassified as faults could be documented in case \\nthey later turn out to be more serious than first \\nthought. Test reports are also inputs to the change \\nmanagement request process (see Software Con -\\nfiguration Control in the Software Configuration \\nManagement KA).\\n5.2.7.\\u2008Defect\\u2008Tracking\\u2008\\n[9*, c9]\\nDefects can be tracked and analyzed to determine \\nwhen they were introduced into the software, \\nwhy they were created (for example, poorly \\ndefined requirements, incorrect variable declara -\\ntion, memory leak, programming syntax error), \\nand when they could have been first observed in \\nthe software. Defect tracking information is used \\nto determine what aspects of software testing \\nand other processes need improvement and how \\neffective previous approaches have been.\\n6. Software Testing Tools \\n6.1. Testing\\u2008Tool\\u2008Support\\u2008\\n[1*, c12s11] [9*, c5]\\nTesting requires many labor-intensive tasks, run-\\nning numerous program executions, and handling \\na great amount of information. Appropriate tools \\ncan alleviate the burden of clerical, tedious opera-\\ntions and make them less error-prone. Sophisti -\\ncated tools can support test design and test case \\ngeneration, making it more effective.\\n6.1.1. Selecting\\u2008Tools\\u2008\\n[1*, c12s11]\\nGuidance to managers and testers on how to select \\ntesting tools that will be most useful to their orga-\\nnization and processes is a very important topic, \\nas tool selection greatly affects testing efficiency \\nand effectiveness. Tool selection depends on \\ndiverse evidence, such as development choices, \\nevaluation objectives, execution facilities, and so \\non. In general, there may not be a unique tool that \\nwill satisfy particular needs, so a suite of tools \\ncould be an appropriate choice. \\n6.2. Categories\\u2008of\\u2008Tools\\u2008\\nWe categorize the available tools according to \\ntheir functionality:\\n• Test\\u2008harnesses (drivers, stubs) [1*, c3s9] \\nprovide a controlled environment in which \\ntests can be launched and the test outputs can \\nbe logged. In order to execute parts of a pro-\\ngram, drivers and stubs are provided to simu-\\nlate calling and called modules, respectively.\\n• Test\\u2008generators [1*, c12s11] provide assis -\\ntance in the generation test cases.

Accordingly, the software product \\nmust change or evolve. Once in operation, defects \\nare uncovered, operating environments change, \\nand new user requirements surface. The mainte -\\nnance phase of the life cycle begins following a \\nwarranty period or postimplementation support \\ndelivery, but maintenance activities occur much \\nearlier. \\nSoftware maintenance is an integral part of a \\nsoftware life cycle. However, it has not received \\nthe same degree of attention that the other phases \\nhave. Historically, software development has had \\na much higher profile than software maintenance \\nin most organizations. This is now changing, as \\norganizations strive to squeeze the most out of \\ntheir software development investment by keep -\\ning software operating as long as possible. The \\nopen source paradigm has brought further atten -\\ntion to the issue of maintaining software artifacts \\ndeveloped by others. \\nIn this Guide, software maintenance is defined \\nas the totality of activities required to provide \\ncost-effective support to software. Activities are \\nperformed during the predelivery stage as well as \\nduring the postdelivery stage. Predelivery activi -\\nties include planning for postdelivery operations, \\nmaintainability, and logistics determination for \\ntransition activities [1*, c6s9]. Postdelivery \\nactivities include software modification, training, \\nand operating or interfacing to a help desk.\\nThe Software Maintenance knowledge area \\n(KA) is related to all other aspects of software \\nengineering. Therefore, this KA description is \\nlinked to all other software engineering KAs of \\nthe Guide. \\nBREAKDOWN OF TOPICS FOR \\nSOFTWARE MAINTENANCE \\nThe breakdown of topics for the Software Main -\\ntenance KA is shown in Figure 5.1.\\n1. Software Maintenance Fundamentals\\nThis first section introduces the concepts and \\nterminology that form an underlying basis to \\nunderstanding the role and scope of software \\nmaintenance. The topics provide definitions and \\nemphasize why there is a need for maintenance. \\nCategories of software maintenance are critical to \\nunderstanding its underlying meaning.\\n1.1. Definitions\\u2008and\\u2008Terminology\\n[1*, c3] [2*, c1s2, c2s2] \\nThe purpose of software maintenance is defined \\nin the international standard for software mainte-\\nnance: ISO/IEC/IEEE 14764 [1*].1 In the context \\nof software engineering, software maintenance is \\nessentially one of the many technical processes. \\n1 For the purpose of conciseness and ease of read -\\ning, this standard is referred to simply as IEEE 14764 \\nin the subsequent text of this KA.

       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 104}, page_content='5-2 SWEBOK® Guide V3.0\\nThe objective of software maintenance is to \\nmodify existing software while preserving its \\nintegrity. The international standard also states \\nthe importance of having some maintenance \\nactivities prior to the final delivery of software \\n(predelivery activities). Notably, IEEE 14764 \\nemphasizes the importance of the predelivery \\naspects of maintenance—planning, for example. \\n1.2. Nature\\u2008of\\u2008Maintenance\\n[2*, c1s3]\\nSoftware maintenance sustains the software prod-\\nuct throughout its life cycle (from development \\nto operations). Modification requests are logged \\nand tracked, the impact of proposed changes is \\ndetermined, code and other software artifacts are \\nmodified, testing is conducted, and a new version \\nof the software product is released. Also, train -\\ning and daily support are provided to users. The \\nterm maintainer is defined as an organization that \\nperforms maintenance activities. In this KA, the \\nterm will sometimes refer to individuals who per-\\nform those activities, contrasting them with the \\ndevelopers.\\nIEEE 14764 identifies the primary activities of \\nsoftware maintenance as process implementation, \\nproblem and modification analysis, modification \\nimplementation, maintenance review/acceptance, \\nmigration, and retirement. These activities are \\ndiscussed in section 3.2, Maintenance Activities.\\nMaintainers can learn from the develop -\\ners’ knowledge of the software. Contact with \\nthe developers and early involvement by the \\nFigure 5.1. Breakdown of Topics for the Software Maintenance KA')),\n",

In some instances, the initial developer \\ncannot be reached or has moved on to other tasks, \\nwhich creates an additional challenge for main -\\ntainers. Maintenance must take software artifacts \\nfrom development (for example, code or docu -\\nmentation) and support them immediately, then \\nprogressively evolve/maintain them over a soft -\\nware life cycle.\\n1.3. Need\\u2008for\\u2008Maintenance\\u2008\\n[2*, c1s5]\\nMaintenance is needed to ensure that the software \\ncontinues to satisfy user requirements. Mainte -\\nnance is applicable to software that is developed \\nusing any software life cycle model (for example, \\nspiral or linear). Software products change due \\nto corrective and noncorrective software actions. \\nMaintenance must be performed in order to\\n• correct faults;\\n• improve the design;\\n• implement enhancements;\\n• interface with other software;\\n• adapt programs so that different hardware, \\nsoftware, system features, and telecommuni-\\ncations facilities can be used;\\n• migrate legacy software; and\\n• retire software.\\nFive key characteristics comprise the maintain-\\ner’s activities:\\n• maintaining control over the software’s day-\\nto-day functions;\\n• maintaining control over software \\nmodification;\\n• perfecting existing functions;\\n• identifying security threats and fixing secu -\\nrity vulnerabilities; and \\n• preventing software performance from \\ndegrading to unacceptable levels.\\n1.4. Majority\\u2008of\\u2008Maintenance\\u2008Costs\\u2008\\n[2*, c4s3, c5s5.2]\\nMaintenance consumes a major share of the finan-\\ncial resources in a software life cycle. A common \\nperception of software maintenance is that it \\nmerely fixes faults. However, studies and sur -\\nveys over the years have indicated that the major-\\nity, over 80 percent, of software maintenance is \\nused for noncorrective actions [2*, figure 4.1]. \\nGrouping enhancements and corrections together \\nin management reports contributes to some mis -\\nconceptions regarding the high cost of correc -\\ntions. Understanding the categories of software \\nmaintenance helps to understand the structure of \\nsoftware maintenance costs. Also, understanding \\nthe factors that influence the maintainability of \\nsoftware can help to contain costs. Some environ-\\nmental factors and their relationship to software \\nmaintenance costs include the following:\\n• Operating environment refers to hardware \\nand software.\\n• Organizational environment refers to poli -\\ncies, competition, process, product, and \\npersonnel.\\n1.5. Evolution\\u2008of\\u2008Software\\u2008\\n[2*, c3s5]\\nSoftware maintenance in terms of evolution was \\nfirst addressed in the late 1960s. Over a period of \\ntwenty years, research led to the formulation of \\neight “Laws of Evolution.” Key findings include a \\nproposal that maintenance is evolutionary devel -\\nopment and that maintenance decisions are aided \\nby understanding what happens to software over \\ntime. Some state that maintenance is continued \\ndevelopment, except that there is an extra input \\n(or constraint)–in other words, existing large soft-\\nware is never complete and continues to evolve; \\nas it evolves, it grows more complex unless some \\naction is taken to reduce this complexity. \\n1.6. Categories\\u2008of\\u2008Maintenance\\u2008\\n[1*, c3, c6s2] [2*, c3s3.1] \\nThree categories (types) of maintenance have \\nbeen defined: corrective, adaptive, and perfec -\\ntive [2*, c4s3].

Software Maintenance Categories\\nCorrection Enhancement\\nProactive Preventive Perfective\\nReactive Corrective Adaptive\\n2. Key Issues in Software Maintenance\\nA number of key issues must be dealt with to \\nensure the effective maintenance of software. \\nSoftware maintenance provides unique techni -\\ncal and management challenges for software \\nengineers—for example, trying to find a fault in \\nsoftware containing a large number of lines of \\ncode that another software engineer developed. \\nSimilarly, competing with software developers \\nfor resources is a constant battle. Planning for a \\nfuture release, which often includes coding the \\nnext release while sending out emergency patches \\nfor the current release, also creates a challenge. \\nThe following section presents some of the tech -\\nnical and management issues related to software \\nmaintenance. They have been grouped under the \\nfollowing topic headings:\\n• technical issues,\\n• management issues,\\n• cost estimation, and\\n• measurement.\\n2.1. Technical\\u2008Issues\\n2.1.1. Limited\\u2008Understanding\\u2008\\n[2*, c6]\\nLimited understanding refers to how quickly a \\nsoftware engineer can understand where to make \\na change or correction in software that he or she \\ndid not develop. Research indicates that about half \\nof the total maintenance effort is devoted to under-\\nstanding the software to be modified. Thus, the \\ntopic of software comprehension is of great inter-\\nest to software engineers. Comprehension is more \\ndifficult in text-oriented representation—in source \\ncode, for example—where it is often difficult to \\ntrace the evolution of software through its releases/\\nversions if changes are not documented and if the \\ndevelopers are not available to explain it, which is \\noften the case. Thus, software engineers may ini-\\ntially have a limited understanding of the software; \\nmuch has to be done to remedy this.\\n2.1.2. Testing\\n[1*, c6s2.2.2] [2*, c9] \\nThe cost of repeating full testing on a major \\npiece of software is significant in terms of time \\nand money. In order to ensure that the requested \\nproblem reports are valid, the maintainer should \\nreplicate or verify problems by running the \\nappropriate tests. Regression testing (the selec -\\ntive retesting of software or a component to ver -\\nify that the modifications have not caused unin -\\ntended effects) is an important testing concept in \\nmaintenance. Additionally, finding time to test is \\noften difficult. Coordinating tests when different \\nmembers of the maintenance team are working ')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 107}, page_content='Software Maintenance 5-5\\non different problems at the same time remains a \\nchallenge. When software performs critical func-\\ntions, it may be difficult to bring it offline to test. \\nTests cannot be executed in the most meaning -\\nful place–the production system. The Software \\nTesting KA provides additional information and \\nreferences on this matter in its subtopic on regres-\\nsion testing.\\n2.1.3. Impact\\u2008Analysis\\n[1*, c5s2.5] [2*, c13s3] \\nImpact analysis describes how to conduct, cost-\\neffectively, a complete analysis of the impact of \\na change in existing software. Maintainers must \\npossess an intimate knowledge of the software’s \\nstructure and content. They use that knowledge \\nto perform impact analysis, which identifies all \\nsystems and software products affected by a soft-\\nware change request and develops an estimate of \\nthe resources needed to accomplish the change. \\nAdditionally, the risk of making the change is \\ndetermined. The change request, sometimes called \\na modification request (MR) and often called a \\nproblem report (PR), must first be analyzed and \\ntranslated into software terms. Impact analysis is \\nperformed after a change request enters the soft -\\nware configuration management process. IEEE \\n14764 states the impact analysis tasks:\\n• analyze MRs/PRs;\\n• replicate or verify the problem;\\n• develop options for implementing the \\nmodification;\\n• document the MR/PR, the results, and the \\nexecution options;\\n• obtain approval for the selected modification \\noption.\\nThe severity of a problem is often used to \\ndecide how and when it will be fixed. The soft -\\nware engineer then identifies the affected com -\\nponents. Several potential solutions are provided, \\nfollowed by a recommendation as to the best \\ncourse of action.\\nSoftware designed with maintainability in mind \\ngreatly facilitates impact analysis. More informa-\\ntion can be found in the Software Configuration \\nManagement KA.\\n2.1.4. Maintainability\\n[1*, c6s8] [2*, c12s5.5]\\nIEEE 14764 [1*, c3s4] defines maintainability \\nas the capability of the software product to be \\nmodified. Modifications may include corrections, \\nimprovements, or adaptation of the software to \\nchanges in environment as well as changes in \\nrequirements and functional specifications.\\nAs a primary software quality characteristic, \\nmaintainability should be specified, reviewed, and \\ncontrolled during software development activi -\\nties in order to reduce maintenance costs. When \\ndone successfully, the software’s maintainability \\nwill improve. Maintainability is often difficult to \\nachieve because the subcharacteristics are often \\nnot an important focus during the process of soft-\\nware development. The developers are, typically, \\nmore preoccupied with many other activities and \\nfrequently prone to disregard the maintainer’s \\nrequirements. This in turn can, and often does, \\nresult in a lack of software documentation and test \\nenvironments, which is a leading cause of difficul-\\nties in program comprehension and subsequent \\nimpact analysis. The presence of systematic and \\nmature processes, techniques, and tools helps to \\nenhance the maintainability of software. \\n2.2. Management\\u2008Issues\\n2.2.1. Alignment\\u2008with\\u2008Organizational\\u2008\\nObjectives\\u2008\\n[2*, c4]\\nOrganizational objectives describe how to demon-\\nstrate the return on investment of software main -\\ntenance activities. Initial software development is \\nusually project-based, with a defined time scale and \\nbudget. The main emphasis is to deliver a product \\nthat meets user needs on time and within budget. \\nIn contrast, software maintenance often has the \\nobjective of extending the life of software for as \\nlong as possible. In addition, it may be driven by \\nthe need to meet user demand for software updates \\nand enhancements. In both cases, the return on \\ninvestment is much less clear, so that the view at \\nthe senior management level is often that of a major \\nactivity consuming significant resources with no \\nclear quantifiable benefit for the organization.')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 108}, page_content='5-6 SWEBOK® Guide V3.0\\n2.2.2. Staffing\\n[2*, c4s5, c10s4]\\nStaffing refers to how to attract and keep soft -\\nware maintenance staff. Maintenance is not often \\nviewed as glamorous work. As a result, software \\nmaintenance personnel are frequently viewed \\nas “second-class citizens,” and morale therefore \\nsuffers.\\n2.2.3. Process\\n[1*, c5] [2*, c5]\\nThe software life cycle process is a set of activities, \\nmethods, practices, and transformations that peo-\\nple use to develop and maintain software and its \\nassociated products. At the process level, software \\nmaintenance activities share much in common \\nwith software development (for example, software \\nconfiguration management is a crucial activity in \\nboth). Maintenance also requires several activities \\nthat are not found in software development (see \\nsection 3.2 on unique activities for details). These \\nactivities present challenges to management.\\n2.2.4. Organizational\\u2008Aspects\\u2008of\\u2008Maintenance\\u2008\\n[1*, c7s2.3] [2*, c10] \\nOrganizational aspects describe how to iden -\\ntify which organization and/or function will be \\nresponsible for the maintenance of software. The \\nteam that develops the software is not necessar -\\nily assigned to maintain the software once it is \\noperational. \\nIn deciding where the software maintenance \\nfunction will be located, software engineering \\norganizations may, for example, stay with the \\noriginal developer or go to a permanent main -\\ntenance-specific team (or maintainer). Having a \\npermanent maintenance team has many benefits:\\n• allows for specialization;\\n• creates communication channels;\\n• promotes an egoless, collegiate atmosphere;\\n• reduces dependency on individuals;\\n• allows for periodic audit checks.\\nSince there are many pros and cons to each \\noption, the decision should be made on a case-by-\\ncase basis. What is important is the delegation or \\nassignment of the maintenance responsibility to a \\nsingle group or person, regardless of the organi -\\nzation’s structure.\\n2.2.5. Outsourcing\\n[3*]\\nOutsourcing and offshoring software mainte -\\nnance has become a major industry. Organiza -\\ntions are outsourcing entire portfolios of soft -\\nware, including software maintenance. More \\noften, the outsourcing option is selected for less \\nmission-critical software, as organizations are \\nunwilling to lose control of the software used in \\ntheir core business. One of the major challenges \\nfor outsourcers is to determine the scope of the \\nmaintenance services required, the terms of a ser-\\nvice-level agreement, and the contractual details. \\nOutsourcers will need to invest in a maintenance \\ninfrastructure, and the help desk at the remote site \\nshould be staffed with native-language speakers. \\nOutsourcing requires a significant initial invest -\\nment and the setup of a maintenance process that \\nwill require automation. \\n2.3. Maintenance\\u2008Cost\\u2008Estimation\\nSoftware engineers must understand the different \\ncategories of software maintenance, discussed \\nabove, in order to address the question of estimat-\\ning the cost of software maintenance. For plan -\\nning purposes, cost estimation is an important \\naspect of planning for software maintenance.\\n2.3.1. Cost\\u2008Estimation\\n[2*, c7s2.4] \\nSection 2.1.3 describes how impact analysis iden-\\ntifies all systems and software products affected \\nby a software change request and develops an \\nestimate of the resources needed to accomplish \\nthat change.\\nMaintenance cost estimates are affected \\nby many technical and nontechnical factors. \\nIEEE 14764 states that “the two most popular \\napproaches to estimating resources for software \\nmaintenance are the use of parametric models \\nand the use of experience” [1*, c7s4.1]. A combi-\\nnation of these two can also be used.')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 109}, page_content='Software Maintenance 5-7\\n2.3.2. Parametric\\u2008Models\\n[2*, c12s5.6]\\nParametric cost modeling (mathematical models) \\nhas been applied to software maintenance. Of sig-\\nnificance is that historical data from past main -\\ntenance are needed in order to use and calibrate \\nthe mathematical models. Cost driver attributes \\naffect the estimates.\\n2.3.3. Experience\\n[2*, c12s5.5]\\nExperience, in the form of expert judgment, \\nis often used to estimate maintenance effort. \\nClearly, the best approach to maintenance esti -\\nmation is to combine historical data and experi -\\nence. The cost to conduct a modification (in terms \\nof number of people and amount of time) is then \\nderived. Maintenance estimation historical data \\nshould be provided as a result of a measurement \\nprogram.\\n2.4. Software\\u2008Maintenance\\u2008Measurement\\n[1*, c6s5] [2*, c12] \\nEntities related to software maintenance, whose \\nattributes can be subjected to measurement, \\ninclude process, resource, and product [2*, \\nc12s3.1]. \\nThere are several software measures that can \\nbe derived from the attributes of the software, \\nthe maintenance process, and personnel, includ -\\ning size, complexity, quality, understandability, \\nmaintainability, and effort. Complexity measures \\nof software can also be obtained using available \\ncommercial tools. These measures constitute a \\ngood starting point for the maintainer’s measure-\\nment program. Discussion of software process \\nand product measurement is also presented in the \\nSoftware Engineering Process KA. The topic of \\na software measurement program is described in \\nthe Software Engineering Management KA.\\n2.4.1. Specific\\u2008Measures\\n [2*, c12]\\nThe maintainer must determine which measures \\nare appropriate for a specific organization based \\non that organization’s own context. The software \\nquality model suggests measures that are specific \\nfor software maintenance. Measures for subchar-\\nacteristics of maintainability include the follow -\\ning [4*, p. 60]:\\n• Analyzability: measures of the maintainer’s \\neffort or resources expended in trying either \\nto diagnose deficiencies or causes of failure \\nor to identify parts to be modified.\\n• Changeability: measures of the maintainer’s \\neffort associated with implementing a speci-\\nfied modification.\\n• Stability: measures of the unexpected behav-\\nior of software, including that encountered \\nduring testing.\\n• Testability: measures of the maintainer’s and \\nusers’ effort in trying to test the modified \\nsoftware.\\n• Other measures that maintainers use include\\n• size of the software,\\n• complexity of the software ,\\n• understandability, and\\n• maintainability.\\nProviding software maintenance effort, by \\ncategories, for different applications provides \\nbusiness information to users and their organiza -\\ntions. It can also enable the comparison of soft -\\nware maintenance profiles internally within an \\norganization. \\n3. Maintenance Process\\nIn addition to standard software engineering pro-\\ncesses and activities described in IEEE 14764, \\nthere are a number of activities that are unique to \\nmaintainers.\\n3.1. Maintenance\\u2008Processes\\n[1*, c5] [2*, c5] [5, s5.5]\\nMaintenance processes provide needed activities \\nand detailed inputs/outputs to those activities as \\ndescribed in IEEE 14764. The maintenance pro -\\ncess activities of IEEE 14764 are shown in Figure \\n5.2. Software maintenance activities include\\n• process implementation, \\n• problem and modification analysis, \\n• modification implementation,')),\n",

Software Maintenance Process \\nOther maintenance process models include: \\n• quick fix,\\n• spiral,\\n• Osborne’s,\\n• iterative enhancement, and\\n• reuse-oriented.\\nRecently, agile methodologies, which promote \\nlight processes, have been also adapted to main -\\ntenance. This requirement emerges from the ever-\\nincreasing demand for fast turnaround of main -\\ntenance services. Improvement to the software \\nmaintenance process is supported by specialized \\nsoftware maintenance capability maturity models \\n(see [6] and [7], which are briefly annotated in the \\nFurther Readings section).\\n3.2. Maintenance\\u2008Activities\\n[1*, c5, c6s8.2, c7s3.3] \\nThe maintenance process contains the activities \\nand tasks necessary to modify an existing soft -\\nware product while preserving its integrity. These \\nactivities and tasks are the responsibility of the \\nmaintainer. As already noted, many maintenance \\nactivities are similar to those of software develop-\\nment. Maintainers perform analysis, design, cod-\\ning, testing, and documentation. They must track \\nrequirements in their activities—just as is done \\nin development—and update documentation as \\nbaselines change. IEEE 14764 recommends that \\nwhen a maintainer uses a development process, \\nit must be tailored to meet specific needs [1*, \\nc5s3.2.2]. However, for software maintenance, \\nsome activities involve processes unique to soft -\\nware maintenance.\\n3.2.1. Unique\\u2008Activities\\n[1*, c3s10, c6s9, c7s2, c7s3] [2*, c6, c7] \\nThere are a number of processes, activities, and \\npractices that are unique to software maintenance:\\n• Program understanding: activities needed to \\nobtain a general knowledge of what a software \\nproduct does and how the parts work together.\\n• Transition: a controlled and coordinated \\nsequence of activities during which software \\nis transferred progressively from the devel -\\noper to the maintainer.\\n• Modification request acceptance/rejection: \\nmodifications requesting work beyond a cer-\\ntain size/effort/complexity may be rejected \\nby maintainers and rerouted to a developer. \\n• Maintenance help desk: an end-user and \\nmaintenance coordinated support function \\nthat triggers the assessment, prioritization, \\nand costing of modification requests. \\n• Impact analysis: a technique to identify areas \\nimpacted by a potential change;\\n• Maintenance Service-Level Agreements \\n(SLAs) and maintenance licenses and con -\\ntracts: contractual agreements that describe \\nthe services and quality objectives.\\n3.2.2. Supporting\\u2008Activities\\n[1*, c4s1, c5, c6s7] [2*, c9] \\nMaintainers may also perform support activities, \\nsuch as documentation, software configuration \\nmanagement, verification and validation, problem \\nresolution, software quality assurance, reviews, ')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 111}, page_content='Software Maintenance 5-9\\nand audits. Another important support activity \\nconsists of training the maintainers and users.\\n3.2.3. Maintenance\\u2008Planning\\u2008Activities\\n[1*, c7s3]\\nAn important activity for software maintenance is \\nplanning, and maintainers must address the issues \\nassociated with a number of planning perspec -\\ntives, including\\n• business planning (organizational level),\\n• maintenance planning (transition level),\\n• release/version planning (software level), and\\n• individual software change request planning \\n(request level).\\nAt the individual request level, planning is \\ncarried out during the impact analysis (see sec -\\ntion 2.1.3, Impact Analysis). The release/version \\nplanning activity requires that the maintainer:\\n• collect the dates of availability of individual \\nrequests,\\n• agree with users on the content of subsequent \\nreleases/versions,\\n• identify potential conflicts and develop \\nalternatives,\\n• assess the risk of a given release and develop \\na back-out plan in case problems should \\narise, and\\n• inform all the stakeholders.\\nWhereas software development projects can \\ntypically last from some months to a few years, \\nthe maintenance phase usually lasts for many \\nyears. Making estimates of resources is a key ele-\\nment of maintenance planning. Software main -\\ntenance planning should begin with the decision \\nto develop a new software product and should \\nconsider quality objectives. A concept document \\nshould be developed, followed by a maintenance \\nplan. The maintenance concept for each software \\nproduct needs to be documented in the plan [1*, \\nc7s2] and should address the\\n• scope of the software maintenance,\\n• adaptation of the software maintenance \\nprocess,\\n• identification of the software maintenance \\norganization, and\\n• estimate of software maintenance costs.\\nThe next step is to develop a corresponding \\nsoftware maintenance plan. This plan should be \\nprepared during software development and should \\nspecify how users will request software modifica-\\ntions or report problems. Software maintenance \\nplanning is addressed in IEEE 14764. It provides \\nguidelines for a maintenance plan. Finally, at \\nthe highest level, the maintenance organization \\nwill have to conduct business planning activities \\n(budgetary, financial, and human resources) just \\nlike all the other divisions of the organization. \\nManagement is discussed in the chapter Related \\nDisciplines of Software Engineering.\\n3.2.4. Software\\u2008Configuration\\u2008Management\\n[1*, c5s1.2.3] [2*, c11] \\nIEEE 14764 describes software configuration \\nmanagement as a critical element of the mainte -\\nnance process. Software configuration manage -\\nment procedures should provide for the verifica -\\ntion, validation, and audit of each step required \\nto identify, authorize, implement, and release the \\nsoftware product. \\nIt is not sufficient to simply track modifica -\\ntion requests or problem reports. The software \\nproduct and any changes made to it must be con-\\ntrolled. This control is established by implement-\\ning and enforcing an approved software configu -\\nration management (SCM) process. The Software \\nConfiguration Management KA provides details \\nof SCM and discusses the process by which soft-\\nware change requests are submitted, evaluated, \\nand approved. SCM for software maintenance is \\ndifferent from SCM for software development in \\nthe number of small changes that must be con -\\ntrolled on operational software. The SCM pro -\\ncess is implemented by developing and following \\na software configuration management plan and \\noperating procedures. Maintainers participate in \\nConfiguration Control Boards to determine the \\ncontent of the next release/version.')),\n",

Software\\u2008Quality\\n[1*, c6s5, c6s7, c6s8] [2*, c12s5.3] \\nIt is not sufficient to simply hope that increased \\nquality will result from the maintenance of soft -\\nware. Maintainers should have a software qual -\\nity program. It must be planned and processes \\nmust be implemented to support the maintenance \\nprocess. The activities and techniques for Soft -\\nware Quality Assurance (SQA), V&V, reviews, \\nand audits must be selected in concert with all \\nthe other processes to achieve the desired level \\nof quality. It is also recommended that the main -\\ntainer adapt the software development processes, \\ntechniques and deliverables (for instance, testing \\ndocumentation), and test results. More details can \\nbe found in the Software Quality KA. \\n4. Techniques for Maintenance\\nThis topic introduces some of the generally \\naccepted techniques used in software maintenance.\\n4.1. Program\\u2008Comprehension\\n[2*, c6, c14s5]\\nProgrammers spend considerable time reading and \\nunderstanding programs in order to implement \\nchanges. Code browsers are key tools for program \\ncomprehension and are used to organize and pres-\\nent source code. Clear and concise documentation \\ncan also aid in program comprehension.\\n4.2. Reengineering\\n[2*, c7]\\nReengineering is defined as the examination and \\nalteration of software to reconstitute it in a new \\nform, and includes the subsequent implementa -\\ntion of the new form. It is often not undertaken to \\nimprove maintainability but to replace aging leg-\\nacy software. Refactoring is a reengineering tech-\\nnique that aims at reorganizing a program without \\nchanging its behavior. It seeks to improve a pro -\\ngram structure and its maintainability. Refactor -\\ning techniques can be used during minor changes. \\n4.3. Reverse\\u2008Engineering\\n[1*, c6s2] [2*, c7, c14s5] \\nReverse engineering is the process of analyzing \\nsoftware to identify the software’s components \\nand their inter-relationships and to create repre -\\nsentations of the software in another form or at \\nhigher levels of abstraction. Reverse engineer -\\ning is passive; it does not change the software \\nor result in new software. Reverse engineer -\\ning efforts produce call graphs and control flow \\ngraphs from source code. One type of reverse \\nengineering is redocumentation. Another type is \\ndesign recovery. Finally, data reverse engineer -\\ning, where logical schemas are recovered from \\nphysical databases, has grown in importance over \\nthe last few years. Tools are key for reverse engi-\\nneering and related tasks such as redocumenta -\\ntion and design recovery.\\n4.4. Migration\\n[1*, c5s5]\\nDuring software’s life, it may have to be modi -\\nfied to run in different environments. In order to \\nmigrate it to a new environment, the maintainer \\nneeds to determine the actions needed to accom -\\nplish the migration, and then develop and docu -\\nment the steps required to effect the migration in \\na migration plan that covers migration require -\\nments, migration tools, conversion of product \\nand data, execution, verification, and support. \\nMigrating software can also entail a number of \\nadditional activities such as\\n• notification of intent: a statement of why \\nthe old environment is no longer to be sup -\\nported, followed by a description of the new \\nenvironment and its date of availability; \\n• parallel operations: make available the \\nold and new environments so that the user \\nexperiences a smooth transition to the new \\nenvironment;\\n• notification of completion: when the sched -\\nuled migration is completed, a notification is \\nsent to all concerned;')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 113}, page_content='Software Maintenance 5-11\\n• postoperation review: an assessment of par -\\nallel operation and the impact of changing to \\nthe new environment;\\n• data archival: storing the old software data.\\n4.5. Retirement\\u2008\\n[1*, c5s6]\\nOnce software has reached the end of its use -\\nful life, it must be retired. An analysis should \\nbe performed to assist in making the retirement \\ndecision. This analysis should be included in the \\nretirement plan, which covers retirement require-\\nments, impact, replacement, schedule, and effort. \\nAccessibility of archive copies of data may also \\nbe included. Retiring software entails a number \\nof activities similar to migration.\\n5. Software Maintenance Tools\\n[1*, c6s4] [2*, c14] \\nThis topic encompasses tools that are particularly \\nimportant in software maintenance where exist -\\ning software is being modified. Examples regard-\\ning program comprehension include\\n• program slicers, which select only parts of a \\nprogram affected by a change; \\n• static analyzers, which allow general view -\\ning and summaries of a program content;\\n• dynamic analyzers, which allow the main -\\ntainer to trace the execution path of a \\nprogram;\\n• data flow analyzers, which allow the main -\\ntainer to track all possible data flows of a \\nprogram;\\n• cross-referencers, which generate indices of \\nprogram components; and\\n• dependency analyzers, which help maintain-\\ners analyze and understand the interrelation-\\nships between components of a program.\\nReverse engineering tools assist the process by \\nworking backwards from an existing product to \\ncreate artifacts such as specification and design \\ndescriptions, which can then be transformed to \\ngenerate a new product from an old one. Main -\\ntainers also use software test, software configura-\\ntion management, software documentation, and \\nsoftware measurement tools.')),\n",

The configuration of a \\nsystem is the functional and physical characteris-\\ntics of hardware or software as set forth in techni-\\ncal documentation or achieved in a product [1]; it \\ncan also be thought of as a collection of specific \\nversions of hardware, firmware, or software items \\ncombined according to specific build procedures \\nto serve a particular purpose. Configuration man-\\nagement (CM), then, is the discipline of identify-\\ning the configuration of a system at distinct points \\nin time for the purpose of systematically control-\\nling changes to the configuration and maintaining \\nthe integrity and traceability of the configuration \\nthroughout the system life cycle. It is formally \\ndefined as\\nA discipline applying technical and admin-\\nistrative direction and surveillance to: iden-\\ntify and document the functional and physi-\\ncal characteristics of a configuration item, \\ncontrol changes to those characteristics, \\nrecord and report change processing and \\nimplementation status, and verify compli -\\nance with specified requirements. [1]\\nSoftware configuration management (SCM) \\nis a supporting-software life cycle process that \\nbenefits project management, development and \\nmaintenance activities, quality assurance activi -\\nties, as well as the customers and users of the end \\nproduct. \\nThe concepts of configuration management \\napply to all items to be controlled, although there \\nare some differences in implementation between \\nhardware CM and software CM.\\nSCM is closely related to the software qual -\\nity assurance (SQA) activity. As defined in the \\nSoftware Quality knowledge area (KA), SQA \\nprocesses provide assurance that the software \\nproducts and processes in the project life cycle \\nconform to their specified requirements by plan -\\nning, enacting, and performing a set of activities \\nto provide adequate confidence that quality is \\nbeing built into the software. SCM activities help \\nin accomplishing these SQA goals. In some proj-\\nect contexts, specific SQA requirements prescribe \\ncertain SCM activities.')),\n",

Management of the SCM Process\\nSCM controls the evolution and integrity of a \\nproduct by identifying its elements; managing and \\ncontrolling change; and verifying, recording, and \\nreporting on configuration information. From the \\nsoftware engineer’s perspective, SCM facilitates \\ndevelopment and change implementation activi -\\nties. A successful SCM implementation requires \\ncareful planning and management. This, in turn, \\nrequires an understanding of the organizational \\ncontext for, and the constraints placed on, the \\ndesign and implementation of the SCM process.\\n1.1.

D] [3*, introduction] [4*, c29]\\nTo plan an SCM process for a project, it is neces-\\nsary to understand the organizational context and \\nthe relationships among organizational elements. \\nSCM interacts with several other activities or \\norganizational elements. \\nThe organizational elements responsible for the \\nsoftware engineering supporting processes may be \\nstructured in various ways. Although the responsi-\\nbility for performing certain SCM tasks might be \\nassigned to other parts of the organization (such as \\nthe development organization), the overall respon-\\nsibility for SCM often rests with a distinct organi-\\nzational element or designated individual. \\nSoftware is frequently developed as part of a \\nlarger system containing hardware and firmware \\nelements. In this case, SCM activities take place \\nFigure 6.1. Breakdown of Topics for the Software Configuration Management KA')),\n",

Note that firmware contains hardware and \\nsoftware; therefore, both hardware and software \\nCM concepts are applicable.\\nSCM might interface with an organization’s \\nquality assurance activity on issues such as \\nrecords management and nonconforming items. \\nRegarding the former, some items under SCM \\ncontrol might also be project records subject to \\nprovisions of the organization’s quality assurance \\nprogram. Managing nonconforming items is usu-\\nally the responsibility of the quality assurance \\nactivity; however, SCM might assist with track -\\ning and reporting on software configuration items \\nfalling into this category.\\nPerhaps the closest relationship is with the \\nsoftware development and maintenance orga -\\nnizations. It is within this context that many of \\nthe software configuration control tasks are con -\\nducted. Frequently, the same tools support devel-\\nopment, maintenance, and SCM purposes.\\n1.2. Constraints\\u2008and\\u2008Guidance\\u2008for\\u2008the\\u2008SCM\\u2008\\nProcess\\u2008\\n[2*, c6, ann. D, ann. E] [3*, c2, c5]\\n [5*, c19s2.2] \\nConstraints affecting, and guidance for, the SCM \\nprocess come from a number of sources. Poli -\\ncies and procedures set forth at corporate or other \\norganizational levels might influence or prescribe \\nthe design and implementation of the SCM pro -\\ncess for a given project. In addition, the contract \\nbetween the acquirer and the supplier might con-\\ntain provisions affecting the SCM process. For \\nexample, certain configuration audits might be \\nrequired, or it might be specified that certain items \\nbe placed under CM. When software products to \\nbe developed have the potential to affect public \\nsafety, external regulatory bodies may impose \\nconstraints. Finally, the particular software life \\ncycle process chosen for a software project and \\nthe level of formalism selected to implement the \\nsoftware affect the design and implementation of \\nthe SCM process. \\nGuidance for designing and implementing an \\nSCM process can also be obtained from “best \\npractice,” as reflected in the standards on software \\nengineering issued by the various standards orga-\\nnizations (see Appendix B on standards).\\n1.3. Planning\\u2008for\\u2008SCM\\u2008\\n[2*, c6, ann. D, ann. E] [3*, c23] [4*, c29]\\nThe planning of an SCM process for a given \\nproject should be consistent with the organi -\\nzational context, applicable constraints, com -\\nmonly accepted guidance, and the nature of the \\nproject (for example, size, safety criticality, and \\nsecurity). The major activities covered are soft -\\nware configuration identification, software con -\\nfiguration control, software configuration status \\naccounting, software configuration auditing, and \\nsoftware release management and delivery. In \\naddition, issues such as organization and respon-\\nsibilities, resources and schedules, tool selection \\nand implementation, vendor and subcontractor \\ncontrol, and interface control are typically con -\\nsidered. The results of the planning activity are \\nrecorded in an SCM Plan (SCMP), which is typi-\\ncally subject to SQA review and audit.\\nBranching and merging strategies should be \\ncarefully planned and communicated, since they \\nimpact many SCM activities. From an SCM stand-\\npoint, a branch is defined as a set of evolving source \\nfile versions [1]. Merging consists in combining \\ndifferent changes to the same file [1]. This typi -\\ncally occurs when more than one person changes a \\nconfiguration item. There are many branching and \\nmerging strategies in common use (see the Further \\nReadings section for additional discussion).\\nThe software development life cycle model \\n(see Software Life Cycle Models in the Software \\nEngineering Process KA) also impacts SCM \\nactivities, and SCM planning should take this \\ninto account. For instance, continuous integration \\nis a common practice in many software develop -\\nment approaches. It is typically characterized by \\nfrequent build-test-deploy cycles. SCM activities \\nmust be planned accordingly. \\n1.3.1. SCM\\u2008Organization\\u2008and\\u2008Responsibilities\\n[2*, ann. Ds5, ann.

Specific responsibilities \\nfor given SCM activities or tasks also need to be \\nassigned to organizational entities, either by title \\nor by organizational element. The overall author-\\nity and reporting channels for SCM should also be \\nidentified, although this might be accomplished \\nat the project management or quality assurance \\nplanning stage.\\n1.3.2. SCM\\u2008Resources\\u2008and\\u2008Schedules\\n[2*, ann. Ds8] [3*, c23]\\nPlanning for SCM identifies the staff and tools \\ninvolved in carrying out SCM activities and tasks. \\nIt addresses scheduling questions by establishing \\nnecessary sequences of SCM tasks and identify -\\ning their relationships to the project schedules \\nand milestones established at the project manage-\\nment planning stage. Any training requirements \\nnecessary for implementing the plans and train -\\ning new staff members are also specified.\\n1.3.3. Tool\\u2008Selection\\u2008and\\u2008Implementation\\u2008\\n[3*, c26s2, c26s6] [4*, c29s5] \\nAs for any area of software engineering, the \\nselection and implementation of SCM tools \\nshould be carefully planned. The following ques-\\ntions should be considered:\\n• Organization: what motivates tool acquisi -\\ntion from an organizational perspective?\\n• Tools: can we use commercial tools or \\ndevelop them ourselves?\\n• Environment: what are the constraints \\nimposed by the organization and its techni -\\ncal context?\\n• Legacy: how will projects use (or not) the \\nnew tools?\\n• Financing: who will pay for the tools’ \\nacquisition, maintenance, training, and \\ncustomization?\\n• Scope: how will the new tools be deployed—\\nfor instance, through the entire organization \\nor only on specific projects?\\n• Ownership: who is responsible for the intro -\\nduction of new tools?\\n• Future: what is the plan for the tools’ use in \\nthe future?\\n• Change: how adaptable are the tools?\\n• Branching and merging: are the tools’ capa -\\nbilities compatible with the planned branch -\\ning and merging strategies?\\n• Integration: do the various SCM tools inte -\\ngrate among themselves? With other tools in \\nuse in the organization?\\n• Migration: can the repository maintained by \\nthe version control tool be ported to another \\nversion control tool while maintaining com -\\nplete history of the configuration items it \\ncontains?\\nSCM typically requires a set of tools, as \\nopposed to a single tool. Such tool sets are some-\\ntimes referred to as workbenches. In such a con -\\ntext, another important consideration in plan -\\nning for tool selection is determining if the SCM \\nworkbench will be open (in other words, tools \\nfrom different suppliers will be used in differ -\\nent activities of the SCM process) or integrated \\n(where elements of the workbench are designed \\nto work together).\\nThe size of the organization and the type of \\nprojects involved may also impact tool selection \\n(see topic 7, Software Configuration Manage -\\nment Tools). \\n1.3.4. Vendor/Subcontractor\\u2008Control\\n[2*, c13] [3*, c13s9, c14s2] \\nA software project might acquire or make use of \\npurchased software products, such as compilers \\nor other tools. SCM planning considers if and \\nhow these items will be taken under configura -\\ntion control (for example, integrated into the proj-\\nect libraries) and how changes or updates will be \\nevaluated and managed.\\nSimilar considerations apply to subcontracted \\nsoftware. When using subcontracted software, \\nboth the SCM requirements to be imposed on \\nthe subcontractor’s SCM process as part of the \\nsubcontract and the means for monitoring com -\\npliance need to be established. The latter includes \\nconsideration of what SCM information must be \\navailable for effective compliance monitoring.')),\n",

Interface\\u2008Control\\n[2*, c12] [3*, c24s4]\\nWhen a software item will interface with \\nanother software or hardware item, a change \\nto either item can affect the other. Planning for \\nthe SCM process considers how the interfacing \\nitems will be identified and how changes to the \\nitems will be managed and communicated. The \\nSCM role may be part of a larger, system-level \\nprocess for interface specification and control; \\nit may involve interface specifications, interface \\ncontrol plans, and interface control documents. \\nIn this case, SCM planning for interface control \\ntakes place within the context of the system-\\nlevel process.\\n1.4. SCM\\u2008Plan\\n[2*, ann. D] [3*, c23] [4*, c29s1]\\nThe results of SCM planning for a given project \\nare recorded in a software configuration manage-\\nment plan (SCMP), a “living document” which \\nserves as a reference for the SCM process. It is \\nmaintained (that is, updated and approved) as \\nnecessary during the software life cycle. In imple-\\nmenting the SCMP, it is typically necessary to \\ndevelop a number of more detailed, subordinate \\nprocedures defining how specific requirements \\nwill be carried out during day-to-day activities—\\nfor example, which branching strategies will be \\nused and how frequently builds occur and auto -\\nmated tests of all kinds are run.\\nGuidance on the creation and maintenance of \\nan SCMP, based on the information produced by \\nthe planning activity, is available from a number \\nof sources, such as [2*]. This reference provides \\nrequirements for the information to be contained \\nin an SCMP; it also defines and describes six cat-\\negories of SCM information to be included in an \\nSCMP: \\n• Introduction (purpose, scope, terms used)\\n• SCM Management (organization, respon -\\nsibilities, authorities, applicable policies, \\ndirectives, and procedures)\\n• SCM Activities (configuration identification, \\nconfiguration control, and so on)\\n• SCM Schedules (coordination with other \\nproject activities)\\n• SCM Resources (tools, physical resources, \\nand human resources)\\n• SCMP Maintenance.\\n1.5. Surveillance\\u2008of\\u2008Software\\u2008Configuration\\u2008\\nManagement\\u2008\\n[3*, c11s3]\\nAfter the SCM process has been implemented, \\nsome degree of surveillance may be necessary \\nto ensure that the provisions of the SCMP are \\nproperly carried out. There are likely to be spe -\\ncific SQA requirements for ensuring compliance \\nwith specified SCM processes and procedures. \\nThe person responsible for SCM ensures that \\nthose with the assigned responsibility perform \\nthe defined SCM tasks correctly. The software \\nquality assurance authority, as part of a compli -\\nance auditing activity, might also perform this \\nsurveillance.\\nThe use of integrated SCM tools with process \\ncontrol capability can make the surveillance \\ntask easier. Some tools facilitate process com -\\npliance while providing flexibility for the soft -\\nware engineer to adapt procedures. Other tools \\nenforce process, leaving the software engineer \\nwith less flexibility. Surveillance requirements \\nand the level of flexibility to be provided to the \\nsoftware engineer are important considerations \\nin tool selection.\\n1.5.1. SCM\\u2008Measures\\u2008and\\u2008Measurement\\n[3*, c9s2, c25s2–s3]\\nSCM measures can be designed to provide spe -\\ncific information on the evolving product or to \\nprovide insight into the functioning of the SCM \\nprocess. A related goal of monitoring the SCM \\nprocess is to discover opportunities for process \\nimprovement. Measurements of SCM processes \\nprovide a good means for monitoring the effec -\\ntiveness of SCM activities on an ongoing basis. \\nThese measurements are useful in characteriz -\\ning the current state of the process as well as in \\nproviding a basis for making comparisons over \\ntime.

For example, information \\nabout the time required to accomplish various \\ntypes of changes would be useful in an evalua -\\ntion of the criteria for determining what levels of \\nauthority are optimal for authorizing certain types \\nof changes and for estimating future changes.\\nCare must be taken to keep the focus of the \\nsurveillance on the insights that can be gained \\nfrom the measurements, not on the measurements \\nthemselves. Discussion of software process and \\nproduct measurement is presented in the Soft -\\nware Engineering Process KA. Software mea -\\nsurement programs are described in the Software \\nEngineering Management KA.\\n1.5.2. In-Process\\u2008Audits\\u2008of\\u2008SCM\\n[3*, c1s1]\\nAudits can be carried out during the software \\nengineering process to investigate the current sta-\\ntus of specific elements of the configuration or to \\nassess the implementation of the SCM process. \\nIn-process auditing of SCM provides a more for-\\nmal mechanism for monitoring selected aspects \\nof the process and may be coordinated with the \\nSQA function (see topic 5, Software Configura -\\ntion Auditing).\\n2. Software Configuration Identification\\n[2*, c8] [4*, c29s1.1] \\nSoftware configuration identification identifies \\nitems to be controlled, establishes identification \\nschemes for the items and their versions, and \\nestablishes the tools and techniques to be used in \\nacquiring and managing controlled items. These \\nactivities provide the basis for the other SCM \\nactivities.\\n2.1. Identifying\\u2008Items\\u2008to\\u2008Be\\u2008Controlled\\u2008\\n[2*, c8s2.2] [4*, c29s1.1]\\nOne of the first steps in controlling change is \\nidentifying the software items to be controlled. \\nThis involves understanding the software config-\\nuration within the context of the system configu -\\nration, selecting software configuration items, \\ndeveloping a strategy for labeling software items \\nand describing their relationships, and identifying \\nboth the baselines to be used and the procedure \\nfor a baseline’s acquisition of the items.\\n2.1.1. Software\\u2008Configuration\\n[1, c3]\\nSoftware configuration is the functional and phys-\\nical characteristics of hardware or software as set \\nforth in technical documentation or achieved in \\na product. It can be viewed as part of an overall \\nsystem configuration.\\n2.1.2. Software\\u2008Configuration\\u2008Item\\n[4*, c29s1.1]\\nA configuration item (CI) is an item or aggre -\\ngation of hardware or software or both that is \\ndesigned to be managed as a single entity. A soft-\\nware configuration item (SCI) is a software entity \\nthat has been established as a configuration item \\n[1]. The SCM typically controls a variety of items \\nin addition to the code itself. Software items with \\npotential to become SCIs include plans, specifi -\\ncations and design documentation, testing mate -\\nrials, software tools, source and executable code, \\ncode libraries, data and data dictionaries, and \\ndocumentation for installation, maintenance, \\noperations, and software use. \\nSelecting SCIs is an important process in \\nwhich a balance must be achieved between pro -\\nviding adequate visibility for project control pur-\\nposes and providing a manageable number of \\ncontrolled items. \\n2.1.3. Software\\u2008Configuration\\u2008Item\\u2008\\nRelationships\\n[3*, c7s4]\\nStructural relationships among the selected \\nSCIs, and their constituent parts, affect other \\nSCM activities or tasks, such as software \\nbuilding or analyzing the impact of proposed \\nchanges. Proper tracking of these relationships \\nis also important for supporting traceability. \\nThe design of the identification scheme for SCIs ')),\n",

Software\\u2008Version\\u2008\\n[1, c3] [4*, c29s3]\\nSoftware items evolve as a software project pro -\\nceeds. A version of a software item is an identi -\\nfied instance of an item. It can be thought of as a \\nstate of an evolving item. A variant is a version of \\na program resulting from the application of soft -\\nware diversity.\\n2.1.5. Baseline\\u2008\\n[1, c3]\\nA software baseline is a formally approved ver -\\nsion of a configuration item (regardless of media) \\nthat is formally designated and fixed at a specific \\ntime during the configuration item’s life cycle. \\nThe term is also used to refer to a particular ver -\\nsion of a software configuration item that has \\nbeen agreed on. In either case, the baseline can \\nonly be changed through formal change con -\\ntrol procedures. A baseline, together with all \\napproved changes to the baseline, represents the \\ncurrent approved configuration.\\nCommonly used baselines include func -\\ntional, allocated, developmental, and product \\nbaselines. The functional baseline corresponds \\nto the reviewed system requirements. The allo -\\ncated baseline corresponds to the reviewed \\nsoftware requirements specification and soft -\\nware interface requirements specification. The \\ndevelopmental baseline represents the evolving \\nsoftware configuration at selected times during \\nthe software life cycle. Change authority for \\nthis baseline typically rests primarily with the \\ndevelopment organization but may be shared \\nwith other organizations (for example, SCM or \\nTest). The product baseline corresponds to the \\ncompleted software product delivered for sys -\\ntem integration. The baselines to be used for a \\ngiven project, along with the associated levels of \\nauthority needed for change approval, are typi -\\ncally identified in the SCMP.\\n2.1.6. Acquiring\\u2008Software\\u2008Configuration\\u2008Items\\n[3*, c18]\\nSoftware configuration items are placed under \\nSCM control at different times; that is, they are \\nincorporated into a particular baseline at a particu-\\nlar point in the software life cycle. The triggering \\nevent is the completion of some form of formal \\nacceptance task, such as a formal review. Figure \\n6.2 characterizes the growth of baselined items as \\nthe life cycle proceeds.

The software change request \\n(SCR) is described in section 3.1.\\nIn acquiring an SCI, its origin and initial integ-\\nrity must be established. Following the acquisi -\\ntion of an SCI, changes to the item must be for -\\nmally approved as appropriate for the SCI and \\nthe baseline involved, as defined in the SCMP. \\nFollowing approval, the item is incorporated into \\nthe software baseline according to the appropriate \\nprocedure.\\n2.2. Software\\u2008Library\\n[3*, c1s3] [4*, c29s1.2]\\nA software library is a controlled collection of \\nsoftware and related documentation designed to \\naid in software development, use, or maintenance \\n[1]. It is also instrumental in software release man-\\nagement and delivery activities. Several types of \\nlibraries might be used, each corresponding to the \\nsoftware item’s particular level of maturity. For \\nexample, a working library could support coding \\nand a project support library could support test -\\ning, while a master library could be used for fin -\\nished products. An appropriate level of SCM con-\\ntrol (associated baseline and level of authority for \\nchange) is associated with each library. Security, \\nin terms of access control and the backup facili -\\nties, is a key aspect of library management. \\nThe tool(s) used for each library must support \\nthe SCM control needs for that library—both in \\nterms of controlling SCIs and controlling access \\nto the library. At the working library level, this is \\na code management capability serving develop -\\ners, maintainers, and SCM. It is focused on man-\\naging the versions of software items while sup -\\nporting the activities of multiple developers. At \\nhigher levels of control, access is more restricted \\nand SCM is the primary user. \\nThese libraries are also an important source \\nof information for measurements of work and \\nprogress.\\n3. Software Configuration Control \\n[2*, c9] [4*, c29s2]\\nSoftware configuration control is concerned \\nwith managing changes during the software \\nlife cycle. It covers the process for determining \\nwhat changes to make, the authority for approv -\\ning certain changes, support for the implementa -\\ntion of those changes, and the concept of formal \\ndeviations from project requirements as well as \\nwaivers of them. Information derived from these \\nactivities is useful in measuring change traffic \\nand breakage as well as aspects of rework.\\n3.1. Requesting,\\u2008Evaluating,\\u2008and\\u2008Approving\\u2008\\nSoftware\\u2008Changes\\u2008\\n[2*, c9s2.4] [4*, c29s2]\\nThe first step in managing changes to controlled \\nitems is determining what changes to make. The \\nsoftware change request process (see a typical \\nflow of a change request process in Figure 6.3) \\nprovides formal procedures for submitting and \\nrecording change requests, evaluating the poten -\\ntial cost and impact of a proposed change, and \\naccepting, modifying, deferring, or rejecting \\nthe proposed change. A change request (CR) is \\na request to expand or reduce the project scope; \\nmodify policies, processes, plans, or procedures; \\nmodify costs or budgets; or revise schedules \\n[1]. Requests for changes to software configura -\\ntion items may be originated by anyone at any \\npoint in the software life cycle and may include \\na suggested solution and requested priority. One \\nsource of a CR is the initiation of corrective \\naction in response to problem reports. Regardless \\nof the source, the type of change (for example, \\ndefect or enhancement) is usually recorded on the \\nSoftware CR (SCR).\\nThis provides an opportunity for tracking \\ndefects and collecting change activity measure -\\nments by change type. Once an SCR is received, \\na technical evaluation (also known as an impact \\nanalysis) is performed to determine the extent of \\nthe modifications that would be necessary should \\nthe change request be accepted. A good under -\\nstanding of the relationships among software \\n(and, possibly, hardware) items is important for \\nthis task. Finally, an established authority—com-\\nmensurate with the affected baseline, the SCI \\ninvolved, and the nature of the change—will \\nevaluate the technical and managerial aspects \\nof the change request and either accept, modify, \\nreject, or defer the proposed change.

Software\\u2008Configuration\\u2008Control\\u2008Board\\u2008\\n[2*, c9s2.2] [3*, c11s1] [4*, c29s2]\\nThe authority for accepting or rejecting proposed \\nchanges rests with an entity typically known as a \\nConfiguration Control Board (CCB). In smaller \\nprojects, this authority may actually reside with \\nthe leader or an assigned individual rather than a \\nmultiperson board. There can be multiple levels \\nof change authority depending on a variety of cri-\\nteria—such as the criticality of the item involved, \\nthe nature of the change (for example, impact on \\nbudget and schedule), or the project’s current \\npoint in the life cycle. The composition of the \\nCCBs used for a given system varies depending \\non these criteria (an SCM representative would \\nalways be present). All stakeholders, appropriate \\nto the level of the CCB, are represented. When \\nthe scope of authority of a CCB is strictly soft -\\nware, it is known as a Software Configuration \\nControl Board (SCCB). The activities of the CCB \\nare typically subject to software quality audit or \\nreview.\\n3.1.2. Software\\u2008Change\\u2008Request\\u2008Process\\n[3*, c1s4, c8s4]\\nAn effective software change request (SCR) pro-\\ncess requires the use of supporting tools and pro-\\ncedures for originating change requests, enforc -\\ning the flow of the change process, capturing \\nCCB decisions, and reporting change process \\ninformation. A link between this tool capability \\nand the problem-reporting system can facilitate \\nthe tracking of solutions for reported problems. \\n3.2. Implementing\\u2008Software\\u2008Changes\\u2008\\n[4*, c29]\\nApproved SCRs are implemented using the \\ndefined software procedures in accordance with \\nthe applicable schedule requirements. Since a \\nnumber of approved SCRs might be implemented \\nsimultaneously, it is necessary to provide a means \\nfor tracking which SCRs are incorporated into \\nparticular software versions and baselines. As \\npart of the closure of the change process, com -\\npleted changes may undergo configuration audits \\nand software quality verification—this includes \\nensuring that only approved changes have been \\nmade. The software change request process \\ndescribed above will typically document the \\nSCM (and other) approval information for the \\nchange. \\nChanges may be supported by source code ver-\\nsion control tools. These tools allow a team of \\nsoftware engineers, or a single software engineer, \\nto track and document changes to the source code. \\nThese tools provide a single repository for storing \\nthe source code, can prevent more than one soft -\\nware engineer from editing the same module at \\nthe same time, and record all changes made to the \\nFigure 6.3.

Software engineers check modules \\nout of the repository, make changes, document \\nthe changes, and then save the edited modules \\nin the repository. If needed, changes can also be \\ndiscarded, restoring a previous baseline. More \\npowerful tools can support parallel development \\nand geographically distributed environments. \\nThese tools may be manifested as separate, \\nspecialized applications under the control of an \\nindependent SCM group. They may also appear \\nas an integrated part of the software engineering \\nenvironment.

Deviations\\u2008and\\u2008Waivers\\u2008\\n[1, c3]\\nThe constraints imposed on a software engineer -\\ning effort or the specifications produced during the \\ndevelopment activities might contain provisions \\nthat cannot be satisfied at the designated point \\nin the life cycle. A deviation is a written autho -\\nrization, granted prior to the manufacture of an \\nitem, to depart from a particular performance or \\ndesign requirement for a specific number of units \\nor a specific period of time. A waiver is a writ -\\nten authorization to accept a configuration item or \\nother designated item that is found, during produc-\\ntion or after having been submitted for inspection, \\nto depart from specified requirements but is nev -\\nertheless considered suitable for use as-is or after \\nrework by an approved method. In these cases, a \\nformal process is used for gaining approval for \\ndeviations from, or waivers of, the provisions. \\n4. Software Configuration Status Accounting\\n[2*, c10]\\nSoftware configuration status accounting (SCSA) \\nis an element of configuration management con -\\nsisting of the recording and reporting of informa-\\ntion needed to manage a configuration effectively. \\n4.1. Software\\u2008Configuration\\u2008Status\\u2008Information\\u2008\\n[2*, c10s2.1]\\nThe SCSA activity designs and operates a sys -\\ntem for the capture and reporting of necessary \\ninformation as the life cycle proceeds. As in any \\ninformation system, the configuration status infor-\\nmation to be managed for the evolving configura-\\ntions must be identified, collected, and maintained. \\nVarious information and measurements are needed \\nto support the SCM process and to meet the con-\\nfiguration status reporting needs of management, \\nsoftware engineering, and other related activities. \\nThe types of information available include the \\napproved configuration identification as well as \\nthe identification and current implementation sta-\\ntus of changes, deviations, and waivers. \\nSome form of automated tool support is neces-\\nsary to accomplish the SCSA data collection and \\nreporting tasks; this could be a database capabil -\\nity, a stand-alone tool, or a capability of a larger, \\nintegrated tool environment. \\n4.2. Software\\u2008Configuration\\u2008Status\\u2008Reporting\\u2008\\n[2*, c10s2.4] [3*, c1s5, c9s1, c17]\\nReported information can be used by various \\norganizational and project elements—including \\nthe development team, the maintenance team, \\nproject management, and software quality activi-\\nties. Reporting can take the form of ad hoc que -\\nries to answer specific questions or the periodic \\nproduction of predesigned reports. Some infor -\\nmation produced by the status accounting activity \\nduring the course of the life cycle might become \\nquality assurance records.\\nIn addition to reporting the current status of the \\nconfiguration, the information obtained by the \\nSCSA can serve as a basis of various measure -\\nments. Examples include the number of change \\nrequests per SCI and the average time needed to \\nimplement a change request. \\n5. Software Configuration Auditing \\n[2*, c11]\\nA software audit is an independent examina -\\ntion of a work product or set of work products to \\nassess compliance with specifications, standards, \\ncontractual agreements, or other criteria [1]. \\nAudits are conducted according to a well-defined \\nprocess consisting of various auditor roles and \\nresponsibilities. Consequently, each audit must \\nbe carefully planned. An audit can require a num-\\nber of individuals to perform a variety of tasks \\nover a fairly short period of time. Tools to support ')),\n",

Informal \\naudits of this type can be conducted at key points \\nin the life cycle. Two types of formal audits might \\nbe required by the governing contract (for exam -\\nple, in contracts covering critical software): the \\nFunctional Configuration Audit (FCA) and the \\nPhysical Configuration Audit (PCA). Successful \\ncompletion of these audits can be a prerequisite \\nfor the establishment of the product baseline. \\n5.1. Software\\u2008Functional\\u2008Configuration\\u2008Audit\\u2008\\n[2*, c11s2.1]\\nThe purpose of the software FCA is to ensure that \\nthe audited software item is consistent with its \\ngoverning specifications. The output of the soft -\\nware verification and validation activities (see \\nVerification and Validation in the Software Qual-\\nity KA) is a key input to this audit.\\n5.2. Software\\u2008Physical\\u2008Configuration\\u2008Audit\\n[2*, c11s2.2]\\nThe purpose of the software physical configura -\\ntion audit (PCA) is to ensure that the design and \\nreference documentation is consistent with the \\nas-built software product.\\n5.3. In-Process\\u2008Audits\\u2008of\\u2008a\\u2008Software\\u2008Baseline\\n[2*, c11s2.3]\\nAs mentioned above, audits can be carried out \\nduring the development process to investigate \\nthe current status of specific elements of the con-\\nfiguration. In this case, an audit could be applied \\nto sampled baseline items to ensure that per -\\nformance is consistent with specifications or to \\nensure that evolving documentation continues to \\nbe consistent with the developing baseline item. \\n6. Software Release Management and \\nDelivery\\n[2*, c14] [3*, c8s2]\\nIn this context, release\\u2008refers to the distribu -\\ntion of a software configuration item outside \\nthe development activity; this includes internal \\nreleases as well as distribution to customers. When \\ndifferent versions of a software item are available \\nfor delivery (such as versions for different plat -\\nforms or versions with varying capabilities), it is \\nfrequently necessary to recreate specific versions \\nand package the correct materials for delivery of \\nthe version. The software library is a key element \\nin accomplishing release and delivery tasks.\\n6.1. Software\\u2008Building\\u2008\\n[4*, c29s4]\\nSoftware building is the activity of combining the \\ncorrect versions of software configuration items, \\nusing the appropriate configuration data, into an \\nexecutable program for delivery to a customer or \\nother recipient, such as the testing activity. For \\nsystems with hardware or firmware, the executable \\nprogram is delivered to the system-building activ-\\nity. Build instructions ensure that the proper build \\nsteps are taken in the correct sequence. In addition \\nto building software for new releases, it is usually \\nalso necessary for SCM to have the capability to \\nreproduce previous releases for recovery, testing, \\nmaintenance, or additional release purposes.\\nSoftware is built using particular versions of \\nsupporting tools, such as compilers (see Com -\\npiler Basics in the Computing Foundations KA). \\nIt might be necessary to rebuild an exact copy of \\na previously built software configuration item. In \\nthis case, supporting tools and associated build \\ninstructions need to be under SCM control to \\nensure availability of the correct versions of the \\ntools. \\nA tool capability is useful for selecting the cor-\\nrect versions of software items for a given target \\nenvironment and for automating the process of \\nbuilding the software from the selected versions \\nand appropriate configuration data. For projects \\nwith parallel or distributed development envi -\\nronments, this tool capability is necessary. Most \\nsoftware engineering environments provide this \\ncapability. These tools vary in complexity from \\nrequiring the software engineer to learn a spe -\\ncialized scripting language to graphics-oriented \\napproaches that hide much of the complexity of \\nan “intelligent” build facility.\\nThe build process and products are often sub -\\nject to software quality verification. Outputs of ')),\n",

Software\\u2008Release\\u2008Management\\u2008\\n[4*, c29s3.2]\\nSoftware release management encompasses the \\nidentification, packaging, and delivery of the \\nelements of a product—for example, an execut -\\nable program, documentation, release notes, and \\nconfiguration data. Given that product changes \\ncan occur on a continuing basis, one concern for \\nrelease management is determining when to issue \\na release. The severity of the problems addressed \\nby the release and measurements of the fault den-\\nsities of prior releases affect this decision. The \\npackaging task must identify which product items \\nare to be delivered and then select the correct \\nvariants of those items, given the intended appli -\\ncation of the product. The information document-\\ning the physical contents of a release is known \\nas a version description document . The release \\nnotes typically describe new capabilities, known \\nproblems, and platform requirements necessary \\nfor proper product operation. The package to be \\nreleased also contains installation or upgrading \\ninstructions. The latter can be complicated by the \\nfact that some current users might have versions \\nthat are several releases old. In some cases, release \\nmanagement might be required in order to track \\ndistribution of the product to various customers \\nor target systems—for example, in a case where \\nthe supplier was required to notify a customer of \\nnewly reported problems. Finally, a mechanism \\nto ensure the integrity of the released item can be \\nimplemented—for example by releasing a digital \\nsignature with it.\\n A tool capability is needed for supporting \\nthese release management functions. It is use -\\nful to have a connection with the tool capability \\nsupporting the change request process in order to \\nmap release contents to the SCRs that have been \\nreceived. This tool capability might also maintain \\ninformation on various target platforms and on \\nvarious customer environments.\\n7. Software Configuration Management Tools\\n[3*, c26s1] [4*, c8s2]\\nWhen discussing software configuration manage-\\nment tools, it is helpful to classify them. SCM \\ntools can be divided into three classes in terms \\nof the scope at which they provide support: indi -\\nvidual support, project-related support, and com-\\npanywide-process support.\\nIndividual\\u2008support\\u2008tools are appropriate and \\ntypically sufficient for small organizations or \\ndevelopment groups without variants of their \\nsoftware products or other complex SCM require-\\nments. They include:\\n• Version control tools: track, document, and \\nstore individual configuration items such as \\nsource code and external documentation.\\n• Build handling tools: in their simplest form, \\nsuch tools compile and link an executable \\nversion of the software. More advanced \\nbuilding tools extract the latest version from \\nthe version control software, perform qual -\\nity checks, run regression tests, and produce \\nvarious forms of reports, among other tasks.\\n• Change control tools: mainly support the \\ncontrol of change requests and events noti -\\nfication (for example, change request status \\nchanges, milestones reached).\\nProject-related\\u2008support\\u2008tools mainly support \\nworkspace management for development teams \\nand integrators; they are typically able to sup -\\nport distributed development environments. Such \\ntools are appropriate for medium to large organi-\\nzations with variants of their software products \\nand parallel development but no certification \\nrequirements.\\nCompanywide-process\\u2008support\\u2008tools can typi -\\ncally automate portions of a companywide pro -\\ncess, providing support for workflow manage -\\nments, roles, and responsibilities. They are able \\nto handle many items, data, and life cycles. Such \\ntools add to project-related support by supporting \\na more formal development process, including \\ncertification requirements.')),\n",

The related discipline of manage-\\nment is an important element of all the knowledge \\nareas (KAs), but it is of course more relevant to \\nthis KA than to other KAs. Measurement is also an \\nimportant aspect of all KAs; the topic of measure-\\nment programs is presented in this KA.\\nIn one sense, it should be possible to manage \\na software engineering project in the same way \\nother complex endeavors are managed. However, \\nthere are aspects specific to software projects \\nand software life cycle processes that complicate \\neffective management, including these:\\n1 The terms Initiating, Planning, Executing, \\nMonitoring and Controlling, and Closing are used to \\ndescribe process groups in the PMBOK® Guide and \\nSWX.\\n• Clients often don’t know what is needed or \\nwhat is feasible.\\n• Clients often lack appreciation for the com -\\nplexities inherent in software engineering, \\nparticularly regarding the impact of chang -\\ning requirements.\\n• It is likely that increased understanding and \\nchanging conditions will generate new or \\nchanged software requirements.\\n• As a result of changing requirements, soft -\\nware is often built using an iterative process \\nrather than as a sequence of closed tasks.\\n• Software engineering necessarily incorpo -\\nrates creativity and discipline.

However, this is not to diminish the \\nimportance of organizational and infrastructure \\nmanagement issues. It is generally agreed that \\nsoftware organizational engineering managers \\nshould be conversant with the project manage -\\nment and software measurement knowledge \\ndescribed in this KA. They should also possess \\nsome target domain knowledge. Likewise, it is \\nalso helpful if managers of complex projects and \\nprograms in which software is a component of \\nthe system architecture are aware of the differ -\\nences that software processes introduce into proj-\\nect management and project measurement.

These poli-\\ncies and procedures may need to be adjusted by \\nthe requirements for effective software develop -\\nment and maintenance. In addition, a number of \\npolicies specific to software engineering may \\nneed to be in place or established for effective \\nmanagement of software engineering at the orga-\\nnizational level. For example, policies are usually \\nnecessary to establish specific organization-wide \\nprocesses or procedures for software engineering \\ntasks such as software design, software construc-\\ntion, estimating, monitoring, and reporting. Such \\npolicies are important for effective long-term \\nmanagement of software engineering projects \\nacross an organization (for example, establishing \\na consistent basis by which to analyze past proj -\\nect performance and implement improvements).\\nAnother important aspect of organizational \\nmanagement is personnel management policies \\nand procedures for hiring, training, and mentor -\\ning personnel for career development, not only at \\nthe project level, but also to the longer-term suc -\\ncess of an organization. Software engineering per-\\nsonnel may present unique training or personnel \\nmanagement challenges (for example, maintaining \\ncurrency in a context where the underlying tech -\\nnology undergoes rapid and continuous change). \\nCommunication management is also often \\nmentioned as an overlooked but important aspect \\nof the performance of individuals in a field where \\nprecise understanding of user needs, software \\nrequirements, and software designs is necessary. \\nFurthermore, portfolio management, which pro -\\nvides an overall view, not only of software cur -\\nrently under development in various projects and \\nprograms (integrated projects), but also of soft -\\nware planned and currently in use in an organiza-\\ntion, is desirable. Also, software reuse is a key \\nFigure 7.1. Breakdown of Topics for the Software Engineering Management KA')),\n",

Effective reuse requires a \\nstrategic vision that reflects the advantages and \\ndisadvantages of reuse. \\nIn addition to understanding the aspects of \\nmanagement that are uniquely influenced by soft-\\nware projects, software engineers should have \\nsome knowledge of the more general aspects of \\nmanagement that are discussed in this KA (even \\nin the first few years after graduation).\\nAttributes of organizational culture and behav-\\nior, plus management of other functional areas \\nof the enterprise, have an influence, albeit indi -\\nrectly, on an organization’s software engineering \\nprocesses. \\nExtensive information concerning software \\nproject management can be found in the Guide \\nto\\u2008the\\u2008Project\\u2008Management\\u2008Body\\u2008of\\u2008Knowledge\\u2008\\n(PMBOK® Guide) and the Software\\u2008Extension\\u2008to\\u2008\\nthe\\u2008PMBOK® Guide (SWX) [1] [2]. Each of these \\nguides includes ten project management KAs: \\nproject integration management, project scope \\nmanagement, project time management, project \\ncost management, project quality management, \\nproject human resource management, project \\ncommunications management, project risk man -\\nagement, project procurement management, and \\nproject stakeholder management. Each KA has \\ndirect relevance to this Software Engineering \\nManagement KA. \\nAdditional information is also provided in the \\nother references and further readings for this KA.\\nThis Software Engineering Management  KA \\nconsists of the software project management pro-\\ncesses in the first five topics in Figure 7.1 (Initia-\\ntion and Scope Definition, Software Project Plan-\\nning, Software Project Enactment, Review and \\nEvaluation, Closure), plus Software Engineering \\nMeasurement in the sixth topic and Software \\nEngineering Management Tools in the seventh \\ntopic. While project management and measure -\\nment management are often regarded as being \\nseparate, and indeed each does possess many \\nunique attributes, the close relationship has led to \\ncombined treatment in this KA. \\nUnfortunately, a common perception of the soft-\\nware industry is that software products are deliv-\\nered late, over budget, of poor quality, and with \\nincomplete functionality. Measurement-informed \\nmanagement—a basic principle of any true engi-\\nneering discipline (see Measurement in the Engi-\\nneering Foundations KA)—can help improve \\nthe perception and the reality. In essence, man -\\nagement without measurement (qualitative and \\nquantitative) suggests a lack of discipline, and \\nmeasurement without management suggests a \\nlack of purpose or context. Effective management \\nrequires a combination of both measurement and \\nexperience.\\nThe following working definitions are adopted \\nhere:\\n• Management\\u2008is a system of processes and \\ncontrols required to achieve the strategic \\nobjectives set by the organization. \\n• Measurement refers to the assignment of val-\\nues and labels to software engineering work \\nproducts, processes, and resources plus the \\nmodels that are derived from them, whether \\nthese models are developed using statistical \\nor other techniques [3* , c7, c8].\\nThe software engineering project management \\nsections in this KA make extensive use of the \\nsoftware engineering measurement section.\\nThis KA is closely related to others in the \\nSWEBOK Guide, and reading the following KA \\ndescriptions in conjunction with this one will be \\nparticularly helpful: \\n• The Engineering Foundations KA describes \\nsome general concepts of measurement that \\nare directly applicable to the Software Engi -\\nneering Measurement section of this KA. \\nIn addition, the concepts and techniques \\npresented in the Statistical Analysis section \\nof the Engineering Foundations KA apply \\ndirectly to many topics in this KA.\\n• The Software Requirements KA describes \\nsome of the activities that should be per -\\nformed during the Initiation and Scope defi -\\nnition phase of the project.\\n• The Software Configuration Management \\nKA deals with identification, control, status \\naccounting, and auditing of software con -\\nfigurations along with software release man-\\nagement and delivery and software configu -\\nration management tools.

That breakdown is shown in \\nFigure 7.1. The elements of the top-level break -\\ndown shown in that figure are the activities that \\nare usually performed when a software develop -\\nment project is being managed, independent of \\nthe software development life cycle model (see \\nSoftware Life Cycle Models in the Software \\nEngineering Process KA) that has been chosen for \\na specific project. There is no intent in this break-\\ndown to recommend a specific life cycle model. \\nThe breakdown implies only what happens and \\ndoes not imply when, how, or how many times \\neach activity occurs. The seven topics are:\\n• Initiation and Scope Definition, which deal \\nwith the decision to embark on a software \\nengineering project;\\n• Software Project Planning, which addresses \\nthe activities undertaken to prepare for a suc-\\ncessful software engineering project from \\nthe management perspective;\\n• Software Project Enactment, which deals \\nwith generally accepted software engineering \\nmanagement activities that occur during the \\nexecution of a software engineering project;\\n• Review and Evaluation, which deal with \\nensuring that technical, schedule, cost, and \\nquality engineering activities are satisfactory; \\n• Closure, which addresses the activities \\naccomplished to complete a project;\\n• Software Engineering Measurement, which \\ndeals with the effective development and \\nimplementation of measurement programs in \\nsoftware engineering organizations; \\n• Software Engineering Management Tools, \\nwhich describes the selection and use of tools \\nfor managing a software engineering project.\\n1. Initiation and Scope Definition \\nThe focus of these activities is on effective deter-\\nmination of software requirements using vari -\\nous elicitation methods and the assessment of \\nproject feasibility from a variety of standpoints. \\nOnce project feasibility has been established, the \\nremaining tasks within this section are the speci -\\nfication of requirements and selection of the pro -\\ncesses for revision and review of requirements.\\n1.1. Determination\\u2008and\\u2008Negotiation\\u2008of\\u2008\\nRequirements\\n[3*, c3]\\nDetermining and negotiating requirements set \\nthe visible boundaries for the set of tasks being \\nundertaken (see the Software Requirements KA). \\nActivities include requirements elicitation, analy-\\nsis, specification, and validation. Methods and \\ntechniques should be selected and applied, taking \\ninto account the various stakeholder perspectives. \\nThis leads to the determination of project scope in \\norder to meet objectives and satisfy constraints. \\n1.2. Feasibility\\u2008Analysis\\n[4*, c4]\\nThe purpose of feasibility analysis is to develop a \\nclear description of project objectives and evalu -\\nate alternative approaches in order to determine \\nwhether the proposed project is the best alterna -\\ntive given the constraints of technology, resources, \\nfinances, and social/political considerations. An \\ninitial project and product scope statement, project \\ndeliverables, project duration constraints, and an \\nestimate of resources needed should be prepared.\\nResources include a sufficient number of \\npeople who have the needed skills, facilities, \\ninfrastructure, and support (either internally or \\nexternally). Feasibility analysis often requires \\napproximate estimations of effort and cost based \\non appropriate methods (see section 2.3, Effort, \\nSchedule, and Cost Estimation). ')),\n",

Process\\u2008for\\u2008the\\u2008Review\\u2008and\\u2008Revision\\u2008of\\u2008\\nRequirements\\n[3*, c3]\\nGiven the inevitability of change, stakeholders \\nshould agree on the means by which requirements \\nand scope are to be reviewed and revised (for \\nexample, change management procedures, itera -\\ntive cycle retrospectives). This clearly implies \\nthat scope and requirements will not be “set in \\nstone” but can and should be revisited at predeter-\\nmined points as the project unfolds (for example, \\nat the time when backlog priorities are created or \\nat milestone reviews). If changes are accepted, \\nthen some form of traceability analysis and risk \\nanalysis should be used to ascertain the impact \\nof those changes (see section 2.5, Risk Manage -\\nment, and Software Configuration Control in the \\nSoftware Configuration Management KA). \\nA managed-change approach can also form the \\nbasis for evaluation of success during closure of \\nan incremental cycle or an entire project, based \\non changes that have occurred along the way (see \\ntopic 5, Closure).\\n2. Software Project Planning\\nThe first step in software project planning should \\nbe selection of an appropriate software develop -\\nment life cycle model and perhaps tailoring it \\nbased on project scope, software requirements, \\nand a risk assessment. Other factors to be consid-\\nered include the nature of the application domain, \\nfunctional and technical complexity, and soft -\\nware quality requirements (see Software Quality \\nRequirements in the Software Quality KA). \\nIn all SDLCs, risk assessment should be an \\nelement of initial project planning, and the “risk \\nprofile” of the project should be discussed and \\naccepted by all relevant stakeholders. Software \\nquality management processes (see Software \\nQuality Management Processes in the Software \\nQuality KA) should be determined as part of the \\nplanning process and result in procedures and \\nresponsibilities for software quality assurance, \\nverification and validation, reviews, and audits \\n(see the Software Quality KA). Processes and \\nresponsibilities for ongoing review and revision \\nof the project plan and related plans should also \\nbe clearly stated and agreed upon.\\n2.1. Process\\u2008Planning\\u2008\\n[3*, c3, c4, c5] [5*, c1]\\nSoftware development life cycle (SDLC) mod -\\nels span a continuum from predictive to adaptive \\n(see Software Life Cycle Models in the Software \\nEngineering Process KA). Predictive SDLCs are \\ncharacterized by development of detailed soft -\\nware requirements, detailed project planning, and \\nminimal planning for iteration among develop -\\nment phases. Adaptive SDLCs are designed to \\naccommodate emergent software requirements \\nand iterative adjustment of plans. A highly pre -\\ndictive SDLC executes the first five processes \\nlisted in Figure 7.1 in a linear sequence with revi-\\nsions to earlier phases only as necessary. Adap -\\ntive SDLCs are characterized by iterative devel -\\nopment cycles. SDLCs in the mid-range of the \\nSDLC continuum produce increments of func -\\ntionality on either a preplanned schedule (on the \\npredictive side of the continuum) or as the prod -\\nucts of frequently updated development cycles \\n(on the adaptive side of the continuum).\\nWell-known SDLCs include the waterfall, \\nincremental, and spiral models plus various forms \\nof agile software development [2] [3*, c2]. \\nRelevant methods (see the Software Engineer -\\ning Models and Methods KA) and tools should be \\nselected as part of planning. Automated tools that \\nwill be used throughout the project should also \\nbe planned for and acquired. Tools may include \\ntools for project scheduling, software require -\\nments, software design, software construction, \\nsoftware maintenance, software configuration \\nmanagement, software engineering process, soft-\\nware quality, and others. While many of these \\ntools should be selected based primarily on the \\ntechnical considerations discussed in other KAs, \\nsome of them are closely related to the manage -\\nment considerations discussed in this chapter. \\n2.2. Determine\\u2008Deliverables\\n[3*, c4, c5, c6]\\nThe work product(s) of each project activity (for \\nexample, software architecture design docu -\\nments, inspection reports, tested software) should \\nbe identified and characterized. Opportunities to \\nreuse software components from previous proj -\\nects or to utilize off-the-shelf software products ')),\n",

Procurement of software \\nand use of third parties to develop deliverables \\nshould be planned and suppliers selected (see \\nsection 3.2, Software Acquisition and Supplier \\nContract Management). \\n2.3. Effort,\\u2008Schedule,\\u2008and\\u2008Cost\\u2008Estimation\\n[3*, c6]\\nThe estimated range of effort required for a proj-\\nect, or parts of a project, can be determined using \\na calibrated estimation model based on historical \\nsize and effort data (when available) and other \\nrelevant methods such as expert judgment and \\nanalogy. Task dependencies can be established \\nand potential opportunities for completing tasks \\nconcurrently and sequentially can be identified \\nand documented using a Gantt chart, for exam -\\nple. For predictive SDLC projects, the expected \\nschedule of tasks with projected start times, dura-\\ntions, and end times is typically produced during \\nplanning. For adaptive SDLC projects, an over -\\nall estimate of effort and schedule is typically \\ndeveloped from the initial understanding of the \\nrequirements, or, alternatively, constraints on \\noverall effort and schedule may be specified and \\nused to determine an initial estimate of the num -\\nber of iterative cycles and estimates of effort and \\nother resources allocated to each cycle. \\nResource requirements (for example, people \\nand tools) can be translated into cost estimates. \\nInitial estimation of effort, schedule, and cost is \\nan iterative activity that should be negotiated and \\nrevised among affected stakeholders until con -\\nsensus is reached on resources and time available \\nfor project completion.\\n2.4. Resource\\u2008Allocation\\n[3*, c5, c10, c11]\\nEquipment, facilities, and people should be allo -\\ncated to the identified tasks, including the allo -\\ncation of responsibilities for completion of vari -\\nous elements of a project and the overall project. \\nA matrix that shows who is responsible for, \\naccountable for, consulted about, and informed \\nabout each of the tasks can be used. Resource \\nallocation is based on, and constrained by, the \\navailability of resources and their optimal use, as \\nwell as by issues relating to personnel (for exam-\\nple, productivity of individuals and teams, team \\ndynamics, and team structures). \\n2.5. Risk\\u2008Management\\n[3*, c9] [5*, c5]\\nRisk and uncertainty are related but distinct con -\\ncepts. Uncertainty results from lack of informa -\\ntion. Risk is characterized by the probability of an \\nevent that will result in a negative impact plus a \\ncharacterization of the negative impact on a proj-\\nect. Risk is often the result of uncertainty. The \\nconverse of risk is opportunity, which is charac -\\nterized by the probability that an event having a \\npositive outcome might occur.\\nRisk management entails identification of risk \\nfactors and analysis of the probability and poten-\\ntial impact of each risk factor, prioritization of \\nrisk factors, and development of risk mitigation \\nstrategies to reduce the probability and minimize \\nthe negative impact if a risk factor becomes a \\nproblem. Risk assessment methods (for example, \\nexpert judgment, historical data, decision trees, \\nand process simulations) can sometimes be used \\nin order to identify and evaluate risk factors. \\nProject abandonment conditions can also be \\ndetermined at this point in discussion with all \\nrelevant stakeholders. Software-unique aspects \\nof risk, such as software engineers’ tendency to \\nadd unneeded features, or the risks related to soft-\\nware’s intangible nature, can influence risk man -\\nagement of a software project. Particular atten -\\ntion should be paid to the management of risks \\nrelated to software quality requirements such as \\nsafety or security (see the Software Quality KA). \\nRisk management should be done not only at the \\nbeginning of a project, but also at periodic inter -\\nvals throughout the project life cycle.\\n2.6. Quality\\u2008Management\\n[3*, c4] [4*, c24]\\nSoftware quality requirements should be identi -\\nfied, perhaps in both quantitative and qualitative \\nterms, for a software project and the associated \\nwork products. Thresholds for acceptable qual -\\nity measurements should be set for each software \\nquality requirement based on stakeholder needs ')),\n",

Procedures concerned with \\nongoing Software Quality Assurance (SQA) and \\nquality improvement throughout the development \\nprocess, and for verification and validation of \\nthe deliverable software product, should also be \\nspecified during quality planning (for example, \\ntechnical reviews and inspections or demonstra -\\ntions of completed functionality; see the Software \\nQuality KA). \\n2.7.\\u2008Plan\\u2008Management\\n[3*, c4]\\nFor software projects, where change is an expec-\\ntation, plans should be managed. Managing the \\nproject plan should thus be planned. Plans and \\nprocesses selected for software development \\nshould be systematically monitored, reviewed, \\nreported, and, when appropriate, revised. Plans \\nassociated with supporting processes (for exam -\\nple, documentation, software configuration man -\\nagement, and problem resolution) also should be \\nmanaged. Reporting, monitoring, and controlling \\na project should fit within the selected SDLC and \\nthe realities of the project; plans should account \\nfor the various artifacts that will be used to man -\\nage the project.\\n3. Software Project Enactment\\nDuring software project enactment (also known \\nas project execution) plans are implemented and \\nthe processes embodied in the plans are enacted. \\nThroughout, there should be a focus on adher -\\nence to the selected SDLC processes, with an \\noverriding expectation that adherence will lead to \\nthe successful satisfaction of stakeholder require-\\nments and achievement of the project’s objec -\\ntives. Fundamental to enactment are the ongoing \\nmanagement activities of monitoring, control -\\nling, and reporting.\\n3.1. Implementation\\u2008of\\u2008Plans\\n[4*, c2]\\nProject activities should be undertaken in accor -\\ndance with the project plan and supporting plans. \\nResources (for example, personnel, technology, \\nand funding) are utilized and work products (for \\nexample, software design, software code, and \\nsoftware test cases) are generated. \\n3.2. Software\\u2008Acquisition\\u2008and\\u2008Supplier\\u2008Contract\\u2008\\nManagement\\n[3*, c3, c4]\\nSoftware acquisition and supplier contract man -\\nagement is concerned with issues involved in \\ncontracting with customers of the software devel-\\nopment organization who acquire the deliverable \\nwork products and with suppliers who supply \\nproducts or services to the software engineering \\norganization. \\nThis may involve selection of appropriate kinds \\nof contracts, such as fixed price, time and materi-\\nals, cost plus fixed fee, or cost plus incentive fee. \\nAgreements with customers and suppliers typi -\\ncally specify the scope of work and the deliver -\\nables and include clauses such as penalties for late \\ndelivery or nondelivery and intellectual property \\nagreements that specify what the supplier or sup-\\npliers are providing and what the acquirer is pay-\\ning for, plus what will be delivered to and owned \\nby the acquirer. For software being developed by \\nsuppliers (both internal to or external to the soft -\\nware development organization), agreements com-\\nmonly indicate software quality requirements for \\nacceptance of the delivered software.\\nAfter the agreement has been put in place, exe-\\ncution of the project in compliance with the terms \\nof the agreement should be managed (see chapter \\n12 of SWX, Software Procurement Management, \\nfor more information on this topic [2]). \\n3.3. Implementation\\u2008of\\u2008Measurement\\u2008Process\\n[3*, c7]\\nThe measurement process should be enacted dur-\\ning the software project to ensure that relevant \\nand useful data are collected (see sections 6.2, \\nPlan the Measurement Process, and 6.3, Perform \\nthe Measurement Process).\\n3.4.

Also, outputs and com -\\npletion criteria for each task should be assessed. \\nDeliverables should be evaluated in terms of their \\nrequired characteristics (for example, via inspec-\\ntions or by demonstrating working functionality). \\nEffort expenditure, schedule adherence, and costs \\nto date should be analyzed, and resource usage \\nexamined. The project risk profile (see section \\n2.5, Risk Management) should be revisited, and \\nadherence to software quality requirements eval -\\nuated (see Software Quality Requirements in the \\nSoftware Quality KA). \\nMeasurement data should be analyzed (see Sta-\\ntistical Analysis in the Engineering Foundations \\nKA). Variance analysis based on the deviation of \\nactual from expected outcomes and values should \\nbe determined. This may include cost overruns, \\nschedule slippage, or other similar measures. \\nOutlier identification and analysis of quality and \\nother measurement data should be performed (for \\nexample, defect analysis; see Software Quality \\nMeasurement in the Software Quality KA). Risk \\nexposures should be recalculated (see section 2.5, \\nRisk Management). These activities can enable \\nproblem detection and exception identification \\nbased on thresholds that have been exceeded. \\nOutcomes should be reported when thresholds \\nhave been exceeded, or as necessary. \\n3.5. Control\\u2008Process\\n[3*, c7, c8]\\nThe outcomes of project monitoring activities \\nprovide the basis on which decisions can be made. \\nWhere appropriate, and when the probability and \\nimpact of risk factors are understood, changes can \\nbe made to the project. This may take the form of \\ncorrective action (for example, retesting certain \\nsoftware components); it may involve incorpo -\\nrating additional actions (for example, deciding \\nto use prototyping to assist in software require -\\nments validation; see Prototyping in the Software \\nRequirements KA); and/or it may entail revision \\nof the project plan and other project documents \\n(for example, the software requirements specifi -\\ncation) to accommodate unanticipated events and \\ntheir implications.\\nIn some instances, the control process may \\nlead to abandonment of the project. In all cases, \\nsoftware configuration control and software con -\\nfiguration management procedures should be \\nadhered to (see the Software Configuration Man-\\nagement KA), decisions should be documented \\nand communicated to all relevant parties, plans \\nshould be revisited and revised when necessary, \\nand relevant data recorded (see section 6.3, Per -\\nform the Measurement Process). \\n3.6. Reporting\\n[3*, c11]\\nAt specified and agreed-upon times, progress to \\ndate should be reported—both within the orga -\\nnization (for example, to a project steering com -\\nmittee) and to external stakeholders (for exam -\\nple, clients or users). Reports should focus on \\nthe information needs of the target audience as \\nopposed to the detailed status reporting within the \\nproject team. \\n4. Review and Evaluation\\nAt prespecified times and as needed, overall prog-\\nress towards achievement of the stated objectives \\nand satisfaction of stakeholder (user and customer) \\nrequirements should be evaluated. Similarly, \\nassessments of the effectiveness of the software \\nprocess, the personnel involved, and the tools and \\nmethods employed should also be undertaken reg-\\nularly and as determined by circumstances.\\n4.1. Determining\\u2008Satisfaction\\u2008of\\u2008Requirements\\n[4*, c8]\\nBecause achieving stakeholder satisfaction is \\na principal goal of the software engineering \\nmanager, progress towards this goal should \\nbe assessed periodically. Progress should be \\nassessed on achievement of major project mile -\\nstones (for example, completion of software \\ndesign architecture or completion of a soft -\\nware technical review), or upon completion of \\nan iterative development cycle that results in \\na product increment. Variances from software \\nrequirements should be identified and appropri -\\nate actions should be taken.\\nAs in the control process activity above (see sec-\\ntion 3.5, Control Process), software configuration ')),\n",

Reviewing\\u2008and\\u2008Evaluating\\u2008Performance\\n[3*, c8, c10]\\nPeriodic performance reviews for project per -\\nsonnel can provide insights as to the likelihood \\nof adherence to plans and processes as well as \\npossible areas of difficulty (for example, team \\nmember conflicts). The various methods, tools, \\nand techniques employed should be evaluated for \\ntheir effectiveness and appropriateness, and the \\nprocess being used by the project should also be \\nsystematically and periodically assessed for rel -\\nevance, utility, and efficacy in the project context. \\nWhere appropriate, changes should be made and \\nmanaged. \\n5. Closure\\nAn entire project, a major phase of a project, \\nor an iterative development cycle reaches clo -\\nsure when all the plans and processes have been \\nenacted and completed. The criteria for project, \\nphase, or iteration success should be evaluated. \\nOnce closure is established, archival, retrospec -\\ntive, and process improvement activities can be \\nperformed.\\n5.1. Determining\\u2008Closure\\n[1, s3.7, s4.6]\\nClosure occurs when the specified tasks for a \\nproject, a phase, or an iteration have been com -\\npleted and satisfactory achievement of the com -\\npletion criteria has been confirmed. Software \\nrequirements can be confirmed as satisfied or not, \\nand the degree of achieving the objectives can \\nbe determined. Closure processes should involve \\nrelevant stakeholders and result in documentation \\nof relevant stakeholders’ acceptance; any known \\nproblems should be documented. \\n5.2. Closure\\u2008Activities\\n[2, s3.7, s4.8]\\nAfter closure has been confirmed, archiving of \\nproject materials should be accomplished in \\naccordance with stakeholder agreed-upon meth -\\nods, location, and duration—possibly including \\ndestruction of sensitive information, software, \\nand the medium on which copies are resident. \\nThe organization’s measurement database should \\nbe updated with relevant project data. A project, \\nphase, or iteration retrospective analysis should \\nbe undertaken so that issues, problems, risks, \\nand opportunities encountered can be analyzed \\n(see topic 4, Review and Evaluation). Lessons \\nlearned should be drawn from the project and fed \\ninto organizational learning and improvement \\nendeavors. \\n6. Software Engineering Measurement \\nThe importance of measurement and its role in \\nbetter management and engineering practices is \\nwidely acknowledged (see Measurement in the \\nEngineering Foundations KA). Effective mea -\\nsurement has become one of the cornerstones \\nof organizational maturity. Measurement can be \\napplied to organizations, projects, processes, and \\nwork products. In this section the focus is on the \\napplication of measurement at the levels of proj -\\nects, processes, and work products.\\nThis section follows the IEEE 15939:2008 \\nstandard [6], which describes a process to define \\nthe activities and tasks necessary to implement a \\nsoftware measurement process. The standard also \\nincludes a measurement information model. \\n6.1. Establish\\u2008and\\u2008Sustain\\u2008Measurement\\u2008\\nCommitment\\n[7*, c1, c2]2\\n• Requirements for measurement.

The organizational \\nunit to which each measurement requirement \\nis to be applied should be established. This \\nmay consist of a functional area, a single \\nproject, a single site, or an entire enterprise. \\nThe temporal scope of the measurement \\neffort should also be considered because \\ntime series of some measurements may be \\nrequired; for example, to calibrate estima -\\ntion models (see section 2.3, Effort, Sched -\\nule, and Cost Estimation). \\n• Team commitment to measurement. The \\ncommitment should be formally established, \\ncommunicated, and supported by resources \\n(see next item). \\n• Resources for measurement.  An organiza -\\ntion’s commitment to measurement is an \\nessential factor for success, as evidenced by \\nthe assignment of resources for implement -\\ning the measurement process. Assigning \\nresources includes allocation of responsibil -\\nity for the various tasks of the measurement \\nprocess (such as analyst and librarian). Ade-\\nquate funding, training, tools, and support to \\nconduct the process should also be allocated. \\n6.2. Plan\\u2008the\\u2008Measurement\\u2008Process\\u2008\\n[7*, c1, c2]\\n• Characterize the organizational unit.  The \\norganizational unit provides the context for \\nmeasurement, so the organizational context \\nshould be made explicit, including the con -\\nstraints that the organization imposes on \\nthe measurement process. The characteriza -\\ntion can be stated in terms of organizational \\nprocesses, application domains, technology, \\norganizational interfaces, and organizational \\nstructure. \\n• Identify information needs.  Information \\nneeds are based on the goals, constraints, \\nrisks, and problems of the organizational \\nunit. They may be derived from business, \\norganizational, regulatory, and/or product \\nobjectives. They should be identified and \\nprioritized. Then a subset of objectives to be \\naddressed can be selected, documented, com-\\nmunicated, and reviewed by stakeholders. \\n• Select measures. Candidate measures should \\nbe selected, with clear links to the informa -\\ntion needs. Measures should be selected \\nbased on the priorities of the information \\nneeds and other criteria such as cost of col -\\nlection, degree of process disruption during \\ncollection, ease of obtaining accurate, con -\\nsistent data, and ease of analysis and report -\\ning. Because internal quality characteristics \\n(see Models and Quality Characteristics in \\nthe Software Quality KA) are often not con -\\ntained in the contractually binding software \\nrequirements, it is important to consider mea-\\nsuring the internal quality of the software to \\nprovide an early indicator of potential issues \\nthat may impact external stakeholders.\\n• Define data collection, analysis, and report -\\ning procedures. This encompasses collection \\nprocedures and schedules, storage, verifica -\\ntion, analysis, reporting, and configuration \\nmanagement of data.\\n• Select criteria for evaluating the information \\nproducts. Criteria for evaluation are influ -\\nenced by the technical and business objec -\\ntives of the organizational unit. Information \\nproducts include those associated with the \\nproduct being produced, as well as those \\nassociated with the processes being used to \\nmanage and measure the project.\\n• Provide resources for measurement tasks. The \\nmeasurement plan should be reviewed and \\napproved by the appropriate stakeholders to \\ninclude all data collection procedures; storage, \\nanalysis, and reporting procedures; evaluation \\ncriteria; schedules; and responsibilities. Crite-\\nria for reviewing these artifacts should have \\nbeen established at the organizational-unit \\nlevel or higher and should be used as the basis \\nfor these reviews. Such criteria should take \\ninto consideration previous experience, avail-\\nability of resources, and potential disruptions \\nto projects when changes from current prac -\\ntices are proposed. Approval demonstrates \\ncommitment to the measurement process.\\n• Identify resources to be made available for \\nimplementing the planned and approved ')),\n",

Resource availability \\nmay be staged in cases where changes are \\nto be piloted before widespread deployment. \\nConsideration should be paid to the resources \\nnecessary for successful deployment of new \\nprocedures or measures.\\n• Acquire and deploy supporting technologies. \\nThis includes evaluation of available supporting \\ntechnologies, selection of the most appropriate \\ntechnologies, acquisition of those technologies, \\nand deployment of those technologies.\\n6.3. Perform\\u2008the\\u2008Measurement\\u2008Process\\n[7*, c1, c2]\\n• Integrate measurement procedures with rel -\\nevant software processes. The measurement \\nprocedures, such as data collection, should \\nbe integrated into the software processes \\nthey are measuring. This may involve chang-\\ning current software processes to accommo -\\ndate data collection or generation activities. \\nIt may also involve analysis of current soft -\\nware processes to minimize additional effort \\nand evaluation of the effect on employees to \\nensure that the measurement procedures will \\nbe accepted. Morale issues and other human \\nfactors should be considered. In addition, the \\nmeasurement procedures should be commu -\\nnicated to those providing the data. Training \\nand support may also need to be provided. \\nData analysis and reporting procedures are \\ntypically integrated into organizational and/\\nor project processes in a similar manner.\\n• Collect data. Data should be collected, veri -\\nfied, and stored. Collection can sometimes \\nbe automated by using software engineer -\\ning management tools (see topic 7, Soft -\\nware Engineering Management Tools) to \\nanalyze data and develop reports.  Data may \\nbe aggregated, transformed, or recoded as \\npart of the analysis process, using a degree \\nof rigor appropriate to the nature of the data \\nand the information needs. The results of \\nthis analysis are typically indicators such as \\ngraphs, numbers, or other indications that \\nwill be interpreted, resulting in conclusions \\nand recommendations to be presented to \\nstakeholders (see Statistical Analysis in the \\nEngineering Foundations KA).

Many of the processes of \\ntraditional engineering disciplines (e.g., electrical, \\nmechanical, civil, chemical) are concerned with \\ntransforming energy and physical entities from \\none form into another, as in a hydroelectric dam \\nthat transforms potential energy into electrical \\nenergy or a petroleum refinery that uses chemical \\nprocesses to transform crude oil into gasoline.\\nIn this knowledge area (KA), software engineer-\\ning processes are concerned with work activities \\naccomplished by software engineers to develop, \\nmaintain, and operate software, such as require -\\nments, design, construction, testing, configura -\\ntion management, and other software engineering \\nprocesses. For readability, “software engineering \\nprocess” will be referred to as “software process” \\nin this KA. In addition, please note that “software \\nprocess” denotes work activities—not the execu-\\ntion process for implemented software.\\nSoftware processes are specified for a number \\nof reasons: to facilitate human understanding, \\ncommunication, and coordination; to aid man -\\nagement of software projects; to measure and \\nimprove the quality of software products in an \\nefficient manner; to support process improve -\\nment; and to provide a basis for automated sup -\\nport of process execution. \\nSWEBOK KAs closely related to this Soft -\\nware Engineering Process KA include Software \\nEngineering Management, Software Engineer -\\ning Models and Methods, and Software Quality; \\nthe Measurement and Root Cause Analysis topic \\nfound in the Engineering Foundations KA is also \\nclosely related. Software Engineering Manage -\\nment is concerned with tailoring, adapting, and \\nimplementing software processes for a specific \\nsoftware project (see Process Planning in the \\nSoftware Engineering Management KA). Mod -\\nels and methods support a systematic approach to \\nsoftware development and modification.\\nThe Software Quality KA is concerned with \\nthe planning, assurance, and control processes \\nfor project and product quality.

Software Process Definition\\n[1*, p177] [2*, p295] [3*, p28–29, p36, c5]\\nThis topic is concerned with a definition of soft -\\nware process, software process management, and \\nsoftware process infrastructure.\\nAs stated above, a software process is a set of \\ninterrelated activities and tasks that transform \\ninput work products into output work products. \\nAt minimum, the description of a software pro -\\ncess includes required inputs, transforming work \\nactivities, and outputs generated. As illustrated in \\nFigure 8.2, a software process may also include \\nits entry and exit criteria and decomposition \\nof the work activities into tasks, which are the \\nsmallest units of work subject to management \\naccountability. A process input may be a trigger-\\ning event or the output of another process. Entry \\ncriteria should be satisfied before a process can \\ncommence. All specified conditions should be \\nsatisfied before a process can be successfully \\nconcluded, including the acceptance criteria for \\nthe output work product or work products.\\nA software process may include subprocesses. \\nFor example, software requirements validation is \\na process used to determine whether the require -\\nments will provide an adequate basis for software \\ndevelopment; it is a subprocess of the software \\nrequirements process. Inputs for requirements val-\\nidation are typically a software requirements spec-\\nification and the resources needed to perform vali-\\ndation (personnel, validation tools, sufficient time). \\nThe tasks of the requirements validation activity \\nmight include requirements reviews, prototyping, \\nand model validation. These tasks involve work \\nassignments for individuals and teams. The output \\nof requirements validation is typically a validated \\nsoftware requirements specification that provides \\ninputs to the software design and software test -\\ning processes. Requirements validation and other \\nsubprocesses of the software requirements process \\nare often interleaved and iterated in various ways; \\nFigure 8.1.

The transforming \\ntasks within a process may be defined as proce -\\ndures; a procedure may be specified as an ordered \\nset of steps or, alternatively, as a checklist of the \\nwork to be accomplished in performing a task.\\nIt must be emphasized that there is no best soft-\\nware process or set of software processes. Soft -\\nware processes must be selected, adapted, and \\napplied as appropriate for each project and each \\norganizational context. No ideal process, or set of \\nprocesses, exists. \\n1.1. Software\\u2008Process\\u2008Management\\u2008\\n[3*, s26.1] [4*, p453–454]\\nTwo objectives of software process management \\nare to realize the efficiency and effectiveness that \\nresult from a systematic approach to accomplish-\\ning software processes and producing work prod-\\nucts—be it at the individual, project, or organiza-\\ntional level—and to introduce new or improved \\nprocesses.\\nProcesses are changed with the expectation that \\na new or modified process will improve the effi -\\nciency and/or effectiveness of the process and the \\nquality of the resulting work products. Changing \\nto a new process, improving an existing process, \\norganizational change, and infrastructure change \\n(technology insertion or changes in tools) are \\nclosely related, as all are usually initiated with the \\ngoal of improving the cost, development sched -\\nule, or quality of the software products. Process \\nchange has impacts not only for the software \\nproduct; they often lead to organizational change. \\nChanging a process or introducing a new process \\ncan have ripple effects throughout an organiza -\\ntion.

Software\\u2008Process\\u2008Infrastructure\\n[2*, p183, p186] [4*, p437–438]\\nEstablishing, implementing, and managing soft -\\nware processes and software life cycle models \\noften occurs at the level of individual software \\nprojects. However, systematic application of \\nsoftware processes and software life cycle mod -\\nels across an organization can provide benefits \\nto all software work within the organization, \\nalthough it requires commitment at the organi -\\nzational level. A software process infrastructure \\ncan provide process definitions, policies for inter-\\npreting and applying the processes, and descrip -\\ntions of the procedures to be used to implement \\nthe processes. Additionally, a software process \\ninfrastructure may provide funding, tools, train -\\ning, and staff members who have been assigned \\nresponsibilities for establishing and maintaining \\nthe software process infrastructure.\\nSoftware process infrastructure varies, depend-\\ning on the size and complexity of the organization \\nand the projects undertaken within the organiza -\\ntion. Small, simple organizations and projects \\nhave small, simple infrastructure needs. Large, \\ncomplex organizations and projects, by neces -\\nsity, have larger and more complex software \\nprocess infrastructures. In the latter case, various \\norganizational units may be established (such as \\na software engineering process group or a steer -\\ning committee) to oversee implementation and \\nimprovement of the software processes.\\nA common misperception is that establishing a \\nsoftware process infrastructure and implementing \\nrepeatable software processes will add time and \\ncost to software development and maintenance. \\nThere is a cost associated with introducing or \\nimproving a software process; however, experi -\\nence has shown that implementing systematic \\nimprovement of software processes tends to result \\nin lower cost through improved efficiency, avoid-\\nance of rework, and more reliable and affordable \\nsoftware. Process performance thus influences \\nsoftware product quality.\\n2. Software Life Cycles\\n[1*, c2] [2*, p190]\\nThis topic addresses categories of software pro -\\ncesses, software life cycle models, software \\nprocess adaptation, and practical considerations. \\nA software development life cycle (SDLC) \\nincludes the software processes used to specify \\nand transform software requirements into a deliv-\\nerable software product. A software product life \\ncycle (SPLC) includes a software development \\nlife cycle plus additional software processes that \\nprovide for deployment, maintenance, support, \\nevolution, retirement, and all other inception-\\nto-retirement processes for a software product, \\nincluding the software configuration management \\nand software quality assurance processes that are \\napplied throughout a software product life cycle. \\nA software product life cycle may include multi -\\nple software development life cycles for evolving \\nand enhancing the software.\\nIndividual software processes have no tempo -\\nral ordering among them. The temporal relation -\\nships among software processes are provided by \\na software life cycle model: either an SDLC or \\nSPLC. Life cycle models typically emphasize \\nthe key software processes within the model \\nand their temporal and logical interdependen -\\ncies and relationships. Detailed definitions of \\nthe software processes in a life cycle model may \\nbe provided directly or by reference to other \\ndocuments. \\nIn addition to conveying the temporal and \\nlogical relationships among software processes, \\nthe software development life cycle model (or \\nmodels used within an organization) includes the \\ncontrol mechanisms for applying entry and exit \\ncriteria (e.g., project reviews, customer approv -\\nals, software testing, quality thresholds, dem -\\nonstrations, team consensus). The output of one \\nsoftware process often provides the input for oth-\\ners (e.g., software requirements provide input for \\na software architectural design process and the \\nsoftware construction and software testing pro -\\ncesses). Concurrent execution of several software \\nprocess activities may produce a shared output \\n(e.g., the interface specifications for interfaces \\namong multiple software components developed \\nby different teams). Some software processes \\nmay be regarded as less effective unless other \\nsoftware processes are being performed at the \\nsame time (e.g., software test planning during \\nsoftware requirements analysis can improve the \\nsoftware requirements).')),\n",

Categories\\u2008of\\u2008Software\\u2008Processes\\n[1*, Preface] [2* , p294–295] [3*, c22–c24] \\nMany distinct software processes have been \\ndefined for use in the various parts of the soft -\\nware development and software maintenance life \\ncycles. These processes can be categorized as \\nfollows:\\n1. Primary\\u2008 processes\\u2008 include software pro-\\ncesses for  development, operation, and \\nmaintenance of software.\\n2.

Organizational\\u2008 processes provide sup -\\nport for software engineering; they include \\ntraining, process measurement analysis, \\ninfrastructure management, portfolio and \\nreuse management, organizational process \\nimprovement, and management of software \\nlife cycle models. \\n4. Cross-project\\u2008processes, such as reuse, soft-\\nware product line, and domain engineering; \\nthey involve more than a single software \\nproject in an organization.\\nSoftware processes in addition to those listed \\nabove include the following.\\nProject management processes include pro -\\ncesses for planning and estimating, resource \\nmanagement, measuring and controlling, leading, \\nmanaging risk, managing stakeholders, and coor-\\ndinating the primary, supporting, organizational, \\nand cross-project processes of software develop -\\nment and maintenance projects. \\nSoftware processes are also developed for \\nparticular needs, such as process activities that \\naddress software quality characteristics (see \\nthe Software Quality KA). For example, secu -\\nrity concerns during software development may \\nnecessitate one or more software processes to \\nprotect the security of the development environ -\\nment and reduce the risk of malicious acts. Soft -\\nware processes may also be developed to provide \\nadequate grounds for establishing confidence in \\nthe integrity of the software. \\n2.2. Software\\u2008Life\\u2008Cycle\\u2008Models\\u2008\\n[1*, c2] [2*, s3.2] [3*, s2.1] [5]\\nThe intangible and malleable nature of software \\npermits a wide variety of software development \\nlife cycle models, ranging from linear models in \\nwhich the phases of software development are \\naccomplished sequentially with feedback and \\niteration as needed followed by integration, test -\\ning, and delivery of a single product; to iterative \\nmodels in which software is developed in incre -\\nments of increasing functionality on iterative \\ncycles; to agile models that typically involve \\nfrequent demonstrations of working software to \\na customer or user representative who directs \\ndevelopment of the software in short iterative \\ncycles that produce small increments of working, \\ndeliverable software. Incremental, iterative, and \\nagile models can deliver early subsets of working \\nsoftware into the user environment, if desired.\\nLinear SDLC models are sometimes referred \\nto as predictive software development life cycle \\nmodels, while iterative and agile SDLCs are \\nreferred to as adaptive software development \\nlife cycle models. It should be noted that vari -\\nous maintenance activities during an SPLC can \\nbe conducted using different SDLC models, as \\nappropriate to the maintenance activities.\\nA distinguishing feature of the various soft -\\nware development life cycle models is the way in \\nwhich software requirements are managed. Lin -\\near development models typically develop a com-\\nplete set of software requirements, to the extent \\npossible, during project initiation and planning. \\nThe software requirements are then rigorously \\ncontrolled. Changes to the software requirements \\nare based on change requests that are processed \\nby a change control board (see Requesting, \\nEvaluating and Approving Software Changes in \\nthe Change Control Board in the Software Con -\\nfiguration Management KA). An incremental \\nmodel produces successive increments of work -\\ning, deliverable software based on partitioning \\nof the software requirements to be implemented \\nin each of the increments. The software require -\\nments may be rigorously controlled, as in a linear \\nmodel, or there may be some flexibility in revising \\nthe software requirements as the software product \\nevolves. Agile models may define product scope \\nand high-level features initially; however, agile ')),\n",

Elements of different approaches may be \\nincorporated into a specific model; for exam -\\nple, an incremental software development life \\ncycle model may incorporate sequential soft -\\nware requirements and design phases but permit \\nconsiderable flexibility in revising the software \\nrequirements and architecture during software \\nconstruction. \\n2.3. Software\\u2008Process\\u2008Adaptation\\n[1*, s2.7] [2*, p51]\\nPredefined SDLCs, SPLCs, and individual soft -\\nware processes often need to be adapted (or \\n“tailored”) to better serve local needs. Organiza -\\ntional context, innovations in technology, project \\nsize, product criticality, regulatory requirements, \\nindustry practices, and corporate culture may \\ndetermine needed adaptations. Adaptation of \\nindividual software processes and software life \\ncycle models (development and product) may \\nconsist of adding more details to software pro -\\ncesses, activities, tasks, and procedures to address \\ncritical concerns. It may consist of using an alter-\\nnate set of activities that achieves the purpose and \\noutcomes of the software process. Adaptation \\nmay also include omitting software processes \\nor activities from a development or product life \\ncycle model that are clearly inapplicable to the \\nscope of work to be accomplished. \\n2.4. Practical\\u2008Considerations\\n[2*, p188–190]\\nIn practice, software processes and activities are \\noften interleaved, overlapped, and applied concur-\\nrently. Software life cycle models that specify dis-\\ncrete software processes, with rigorously specified \\nentry and exit criteria and prescribed boundaries \\nand interfaces, should be recognized as idealiza -\\ntions that must be adapted to reflect the realities of \\nsoftware development and maintenance within the \\norganizational context and business environment. \\nAnother practical consideration: software \\nprocesses (such as configuration management, \\nconstruction, and testing) can be adapted to facili-\\ntate operation, support, maintenance, migration, \\nand retirement of the software.\\nAdditional factors to be considered when \\ndefining and tailoring a software life cycle model \\ninclude required conformance to standards, direc-\\ntives, and policies; customer demands; criticality \\nof the software product; and organizational matu-\\nrity and competencies. Other factors include the \\nnature of the work (e.g., modification of exist -\\ning software versus new development) and the \\napplication domain (e.g., aerospace versus hotel \\nmanagement).\\n3. Software Process Assessment and \\nImprovement\\n[2*, p188, p194] [3*, c26] [4*, p397, c15]\\nThis topic addresses software process assess -\\nment models, software process assessment meth-\\nods, software process improvement models, and \\ncontinuous and staged process ratings. Software \\nprocess assessments are used to evaluate the form \\nand content of a software process, which may \\nbe specified by a standardized set of criteria. In \\nsome instances, the terms “process appraisal” \\nand “capability evaluation” are used instead of \\nprocess assessment.

The efficiency of a software process, activity, \\nor task is the ratio of resources actually consumed \\nto resources expected or desired to be consumed \\nin accomplishing a software process, activity, or \\ntask (see Efficiency in the Software Engineering \\nEconomics KA). Effort (or equivalent cost) is the \\nprimary measure of resources for most software \\nprocesses, activities, and tasks; it is measured in \\nunits such as person-hours, person-days, staff-\\nweeks, or staff-months of effort or in equivalent \\nmonetary units—such as euros or dollars.\\nEffectiveness is the ratio of actual output to \\nexpected output produced by a software process, \\nactivity, or task; for example, actual number of \\ndefects detected and corrected during software \\ntesting to expected number of defects to be \\ndetected and corrected—perhaps based on his -\\ntorical data for similar projects (see Effectiveness \\nin the Software Engineering Economics KA). \\nNote that measurement of software process effec-\\ntiveness requires measurement of the relevant \\nproduct attributes; for example, measurement of \\nsoftware defects discovered and corrected during \\nsoftware testing. \\nOne must take care when measuring product \\nattributes for the purpose of determining process \\neffectiveness. For example, the number of defects \\ndetected and corrected by testing may not achieve \\nthe expected number of defects and thus provide \\na misleadingly low effectiveness measure, either \\nbecause the software being tested is of better-\\nthan-usual quality or perhaps because introduc -\\ntion of a newly introduced upstream inspection \\nprocess has reduced the remaining number of \\ndefects in the software.\\nProduct measures that may be important in \\ndetermining the effectiveness of software pro -\\ncesses include product complexity, total defects, \\ndefect density, and the quality of requirements, \\ndesign documentation, and other related work \\nproducts.\\nAlso note that efficiency and effectiveness are \\nindependent concepts. An effective software pro-\\ncess can be inefficient in achieving a desired soft-\\nware process result; for example, the amount of \\neffort expended to find and fix software defects \\ncould be very high and result in low efficiency, as \\ncompared to expectations. \\nAn efficient process can be ineffective in accom-\\nplishing the desired transformation of input work \\nproducts into output work products; for example, \\nfailure to find and correct a sufficient number of \\nsoftware defects during the testing process. \\nCauses of low efficiency and/or low effective -\\nness in the way a software process, activity, or \\ntask is executed might include one or more of the \\nfollowing problems: deficient input work prod -\\nucts, inexperienced personnel, lack of adequate \\ntools and infrastructure, learning a new process, \\na complex product, or an unfamiliar product \\ndomain. The efficiency and effectiveness of soft-\\nware process execution are also affected (either \\npositively or negatively) by factors such as turn -\\nover in software personnel, schedule changes, a \\nnew customer representative, or a new organiza -\\ntional policy.\\nIn software engineering, productivity in per -\\nforming a process, activity, or task is the ratio of \\noutput produced divided by resources consumed; \\nfor example, the number of software defects dis -\\ncovered and corrected divided by person-hours of \\neffort (see Productivity in the Software Engineer-\\ning Economics KA). Accurate measurement of \\nproductivity must include total effort used to sat-\\nisfy the exit criteria of a software process, activ -\\nity, or task; for example, the effort required to \\ncorrect defects discovered during software test -\\ning must be included in software development \\nproductivity. \\nCalculation of productivity must account for \\nthe context in which the work is accomplished. \\nFor example, the effort to correct discovered \\ndefects will be included in the productivity cal -\\nculation of a software team if team members \\ncorrect the defects they find—as in unit testing \\nby software developers or in a cross-functional \\nagile team. Or the productivity calculation \\nmay include either the effort of the software ')),\n",

Note that this \\nexample refers to the effort of teams of devel -\\nopers or teams of testers and not to individuals. \\nSoftware productivity calculated at the level of \\nindividuals can be misleading because of the \\nmany factors that can affect the individual pro -\\nductivity of software engineers.\\nStandardized definitions and counting rules \\nfor measurement of software processes and work \\nproducts are necessary to provide standardized \\nmeasurement results across projects within an \\norganization, to populate a repository of histori -\\ncal data that can be analyzed to identify software \\nprocesses that need to be improved, and to build \\npredictive models based on accumulated data. In \\nthe example above, definitions of software defects \\nand staff-hours of testing effort plus counting \\nrules for defects and effort would be necessary to \\nobtain satisfactory measurement results.\\nThe extent to which the software process is \\ninstitutionalized is important; failure to institu -\\ntionalize a software process may explain why \\n“good” software processes do not always pro -\\nduce anticipated results.

Stakeholders \\nare those persons or parties who have a stated \\nor implied interest in the software (for example, \\nuser, buyer, supplier, architect, certifying author-\\nity, evaluator, developer, software engineer, and \\nperhaps others). \\nWhile there are many modeling languages, \\nnotations, techniques, and tools in the literature \\nand in practice, there are unifying general con -\\ncepts that apply in some form to them all. The \\nfollowing sections provide background on these \\ngeneral concepts.\\n1.1. Modeling\\u2008Principles\\u2008\\n[1*, c2s2, c5s1, c5s2] [2*, c2s2] [3*, c5s0]\\nModeling provides the software engineer with \\nan organized and systematic approach for repre -\\nsenting significant aspects of the software under \\nstudy, facilitating decision-making about the soft-\\nware or elements of it, and communicating those \\nsignificant decisions to others in the stakeholder \\ncommunities. There are three general principles \\nguiding such modeling activities:\\n• Model\\u2008the\\u2008Essentials: good models do not \\nusually represent every aspect or feature of \\nthe software under every possible condition. \\nModeling typically involves developing only \\nthose aspects or features of the software that \\nneed specific answers, abstracting away any \\nnonessential information. This approach \\nkeeps the models manageable and useful.\\n• Provide\\u2008 Perspective: modeling provides \\nviews of the software under study using \\na defined set of rules for expression of the \\nmodel within each view. This perspective-\\ndriven approach provides dimensionality to \\nthe model (for example, a structural view, \\nbehavioral view, temporal view, organiza -\\ntional view, and other views as relevant). \\nOrganizing information into views focuses \\nthe software modeling efforts on specific \\nFigure 9.1.

When used rigorously \\nand systematically, this modeling results in \\na reporting approach that facilitates effective \\ncommunication of software information to \\nproject stakeholders. \\nA model is an abstraction or simplification of \\na software component. A consequence of using \\nabstraction is that no single abstraction com -\\npletely describes a software component. Rather, \\nthe model of the software is represented as an \\naggregation of abstractions, which—when taken \\ntogether—describe only selected aspects, per -\\nspectives, or views—only those that are needed \\nto make informed decisions and respond to the \\nreasons for creating the model in the first place. \\nThis simplification leads to a set of assumptions \\nabout the context within which the model is \\nplaced that should also be captured in the model. \\nThen, when reusing the model, these assumptions \\ncan be validated first to establish the relevancy of \\nthe reused model within its new use and context.\\n1.2. Properties\\u2008and\\u2008Expression\\u2008of\\u2008Models\\n[1*, c5s2, c5s3] [3*, c4s1.1p7, c4s6p3, \\nc5s0p3]\\nProperties of models are those distinguishing fea-\\ntures of a particular model used to characterize \\nits completeness, consistency, and correctness \\nwithin the chosen modeling notation and tooling \\nused. Properties of models include the following:\\n• Completeness: the degree to which all \\nrequirements have been implemented and \\nverified within the model.\\n• Consistency: the degree to which the model \\ncontains no conflicting requirements, asser -\\ntions, constraints, functions, or component \\ndescriptions.\\n• Correctness: the degree to which the model \\nsatisfies its requirements and design specifi -\\ncations and is free of defects.\\nModels are constructed to represent real-world \\nobjects and their behaviors to answer specific \\nquestions about how the software is expected \\nto operate. Interrogating the models—either \\nthrough exploration, simulation, or review—may \\nexpose areas of uncertainty within the model and \\nthe software to which the model refers. These \\nuncertainties or unanswered questions regarding \\nthe requirements, design, and/or implementation \\ncan then be handled appropriately.\\nThe primary expression element of a model is \\nan entity. An entity may represent concrete arti -\\nfacts (for example, processors, sensors, or robots) \\nor abstract artifacts (for example, software mod -\\nules or communication protocols). Model enti -\\nties are connected to other entities using rela -\\ntions (in other words, lines or textual operators \\non target entities). Expression of model entities \\nmay be accomplished using textual or graphical \\nmodeling languages; both modeling language \\ntypes connect model entities through specific lan-\\nguage constructs. The meaning of an entity may \\nbe represented by its shape, textual attributes, or \\nboth. Generally, textual information adheres to \\nlanguage-specific syntactic structure. The pre -\\ncise meanings related to the modeling of context, \\nstructure, or behavior using these entities and \\nrelations is dependent on the modeling language \\nused, the design rigor applied to the modeling \\neffort, the specific view being constructed, and \\nthe entity to which the specific notation element \\nmay be attached. Multiple views of the model \\nmay be required to capture the needed semantics \\nof the software.\\nWhen using models supported with automa -\\ntion, models may be checked for completeness \\nand consistency. The usefulness of these checks \\ndepends greatly on the level of semantic and syn-\\ntactic rigor applied to the modeling effort in addi-\\ntion to explicit tool support. Correctness is typi -\\ncally checked through simulation and/or review.\\n1.3. Syntax,\\u2008Semantics,\\u2008and\\u2008Pragmatics\\n[2* c2s2.2.2p6] [3*, c5s0]\\nModels can be surprisingly deceptive. The fact \\nthat a model is an abstraction with missing infor-\\nmation can lead one into a false sense of com -\\npletely understanding the software from a single \\nmodel. A complete model (“complete” being ')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 164}, page_content='9-4 SWEBOK® Guide V3.0\\nrelative to the modeling effort) may be a union \\nof multiple submodels and any special function \\nmodels. Examination and decision-making rela -\\ntive to a single model within this collection of \\nsubmodels may be problematic.\\nUnderstanding the precise meanings of mod -\\neling constructs can also be difficult. Modeling \\nlanguages are defined by syntactic and semantic \\nrules. For textual languages, syntax is defined \\nusing a notation grammar that defines valid lan -\\nguage constructs (for example, Backus-Naur \\nForm (BNF)). For graphical languages, syntax is \\ndefined using graphical models called metamod -\\nels. As with BNF, metamodels define the valid \\nsyntactical constructs of a graphical modeling \\nlanguage; the metamodel defines how these con -\\nstructs can be composed to produce valid models.\\nSemantics for modeling languages specify the \\nmeaning attached to the entities and relations \\ncaptured within the model. For example, a simple \\ndiagram of two boxes connected by a line is open \\nto a variety of interpretations. Knowing that the \\ndiagram on which the boxes are placed and con -\\nnected is an object diagram or an activity diagram \\ncan assist in the interpretation of this model. \\nAs a practical matter, there is usually a good \\nunderstanding of the semantics of a specific \\nsoftware model due to the modeling language \\nselected, how that modeling language is used to \\nexpress entities and relations within that model, \\nthe experience base of the modeler(s), and the \\ncontext within which the modeling has been \\nundertaken and so represented. Meaning is com -\\nmunicated through the model even in the presence \\nof incomplete information through abstraction; \\npragmatics explains how meaning is embodied \\nin the model and its context and communicated \\neffectively to other software engineers.\\nThere are still instances, however, where cau -\\ntion is needed regarding modeling and semantics. \\nFor example, any model parts imported from \\nanother model or library must be examined for \\nsemantic assumptions that conflict in the new \\nmodeling environment; this may not be obvious. \\nThe model should be checked for documented \\nassumptions. While modeling syntax may be \\nidentical, the model may mean something quite \\ndifferent in the new environment, which is a dif -\\nferent context. Also, consider that as software \\nmatures and changes are made, semantic discord \\ncan be introduced, leading to errors. With many \\nsoftware engineers working on a model part over \\ntime coupled with tool updates and perhaps new \\nrequirements, there are opportunities for portions \\nof the model to represent something different \\nfrom the original author’s intent and initial model \\ncontext.\\n1.4. Preconditions,\\u2008Postconditions,\\u2008and\\u2008\\nInvariants\\n[2*, c4s4] [4*, c10s4p2, c10s5p2p4]\\nWhen modeling functions or methods, the soft -\\nware engineer typically starts with a set of \\nassumptions about the state of the software prior \\nto, during, and after the function or method exe -\\ncutes. These assumptions are essential to the cor-\\nrect operation of the function or method and are \\ngrouped, for discussion, as a set of preconditions, \\npostconditions, and invariants. \\n• Preconditions: a set of conditions that must \\nbe satisfied prior to execution of the function \\nor method. If these preconditions do not hold \\nprior to execution of the function or method, \\nthe function or method may produce errone -\\nous results.\\n• Postconditions: a set of conditions that is \\nguaranteed to be true after the function or \\nmethod has executed successfully. Typically, \\nthe postconditions represent how the state \\nof the software has changed, how param -\\neters passed to the function or method have \\nchanged, how data values have changed, or \\nhow the return value has been affected.\\n• Invariants: a set of conditions within the \\noperational environment that persist (in \\nother words, do not change) before and after \\nexecution of the function or method. These \\ninvariants are relevant and necessary to the \\nsoftware and the correct operation of the \\nfunction or method.\\n2. Types of Models\\nA typical model consists of an aggregation of \\nsubmodels. Each submodel is a partial descrip -\\ntion and is created for a specific purpose; it may \\nbe comprised of one or more diagrams. The \\ncollection of submodels may employ multiple ')),\n",

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) \\nrecognizes a rich collection of modeling dia -\\ngrams. Use of these diagrams, along with the \\nmodeling language constructs, brings about three \\nbroad model types commonly used: information \\nmodels, behavioral models, and structure models \\n(see section 1.1).\\n2.1. Information\\u2008Modeling\\n[1*, c7s2.2] [3*, c8s1]\\nInformation models provide a central focus on \\ndata and information. An information model is an \\nabstract representation that identifies and defines \\na set of concepts, properties, relations, and con -\\nstraints on data entities. The semantic or concep-\\ntual information model is often used to provide \\nsome formalism and context to the software being \\nmodeled as viewed from the problem perspective, \\nwithout concern for how this model is actually \\nmapped to the implementation of the software. \\nThe semantic or conceptual information model \\nis an abstraction and, as such, includes only the \\nconcepts, properties, relations, and constraints \\nneeded to conceptualize the real-world view of \\nthe information. Subsequent transformations of \\nthe semantic or conceptual information model \\nlead to the elaboration of logical and then physi -\\ncal data models as implemented in the software.\\n2.2. Behavioral\\u2008Modeling\\n[1*, c7s2.1, c7s2.3, c7s2.4] [2*, c9s2]\\n [3*, c5s4]\\nBehavioral models identify and define the func -\\ntions of the software being modeled. Behav -\\nioral models generally take three basic forms: \\nstate machines, control-flow models, and data-\\nflow models. State machines provide a model \\nof the software as a collection of defined states, \\nevents, and transitions. The software transitions \\nfrom one state to the next by way of a guarded \\nor unguarded triggering event that occurs in the \\nmodeled environment. Control-flow models \\ndepict how a sequence of events causes processes \\nto be activated or deactivated. Data-flow behav -\\nior is typified as a sequence of steps where data \\nmoves through processes toward data stores or \\ndata sinks.\\n2.3. Structure\\u2008Modeling\\n[1*, c7s2.5, c7s3.1, c7s3.2] [3*, c5s3] [4*, c4]\\nStructure models illustrate the physical or logical \\ncomposition of software from its various com -\\nponent parts. Structure modeling establishes the \\ndefined boundary between the software being \\nimplemented or modeled and the environment \\nin which it is to operate. Some common struc -\\ntural constructs used in structure modeling are \\ncomposition, decomposition, generalization, and \\nspecialization of entities; identification of rel -\\nevant relations and cardinality between entities; \\nand the definition of process or functional inter -\\nfaces. Structure diagrams provided by the UML \\nfor structure modeling include class, component, \\nobject, deployment, and packaging diagrams.\\n3. Analysis of Models\\nThe development of models affords the software \\nengineer an opportunity to study, reason about, \\nand understand the structure, function, opera -\\ntional usage, and assembly considerations asso -\\nciated with software. Analysis of constructed \\nmodels is needed to ensure that these models are \\ncomplete, consistent, and correct enough to serve \\ntheir intended purpose for the stakeholders.\\nThe sections that follow briefly describe the \\nanalysis techniques generally used with soft -\\nware models to ensure that the software engineer \\nand other relevant stakeholders gain appropriate \\nvalue from the development and use of models.\\n3.1. Analyzing\\u2008for\\u2008Completeness\\n[3*, c4s1.1p7, c4s6] [5*, p8–11]\\nIn order to have software that fully meets the needs \\nof the stakeholders, completeness is critical—from \\nthe requirements elicitation process to code imple-\\nmentation. Completeness is the degree to which \\nall of the specified requirements have been imple-\\nmented and verified. Models may be checked for \\ncompleteness by a modeling tool that uses tech -\\nniques such as structural analysis and state-space \\nreachability analysis (which ensure that all paths in \\nthe state models are reached by some set of correct \\ninputs); models may also be checked for complete-\\nness manually by using inspections or other review \\ntechniques (see the Software Quality KA). Errors ')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 166}, page_content='9-6 SWEBOK® Guide V3.0\\nand warnings generated by these analysis tools and \\nfound by inspection or review indicate probable \\nneeded corrective actions to ensure completeness \\nof the models.\\n3.2. Analyzing\\u2008for\\u2008Consistency\\n[3*, c4s1.1p7, c4s6] [5*, p8–11]\\nConsistency is the degree to which models con -\\ntain no conflicting requirements, assertions, con -\\nstraints, functions, or component descriptions. \\nTypically, consistency checking is accomplished \\nwith the modeling tool using an automated analysis \\nfunction; models may also be checked for consis-\\ntency manually using inspections or other review \\ntechniques (see the Software Quality KA). As \\nwith completeness, errors and warnings generated \\nby these analysis tools and found by inspection or \\nreview indicate the need for corrective action.\\n3.3. Analyzing\\u2008for\\u2008Correctness\\n[5*, p8–11]\\nCorrectness is the degree to which a model sat -\\nisfies its software requirements and software \\ndesign specifications, is free of defects, and ulti -\\nmately meets the stakeholders’ needs. Analyzing \\nfor correctness includes verifying syntactic cor -\\nrectness of the model (that is, correct use of the \\nmodeling language grammar and constructs) and \\nverifying semantic correctness of the model (that \\nis, use of the modeling language constructs to \\ncorrectly represent the meaning of that which is \\nbeing modeled). To analyze a model for syntactic \\nand semantic correctness, one analyzes it—either \\nautomatically (for example, using the modeling \\ntool to check for model syntactic correctness) \\nor manually (using inspections or other review \\ntechniques)—searching for possible defects and \\nthen removing or repairing the confirmed defects \\nbefore the software is released for use.\\n3.4. Traceability\\n[3*, c4s7.1, c4s7.2]\\nDeveloping software typically involves the use, \\ncreation, and modification of many work products \\nsuch as planning documents, process specifica -\\ntions, software requirements, diagrams, designs \\nand pseudo-code, handwritten and tool-generated \\ncode, manual and automated test cases and reports, \\nand files and data. These work products may be \\nrelated through various dependency relationships \\n(for example, uses, implements, and tests). As soft-\\nware is being developed, managed, maintained, or \\nextended, there is a need to map and control these \\ntraceability relationships to demonstrate soft -\\nware requirements consistency with the software \\nmodel (see Requirements Tracing in the Software \\nRequirements KA) and the many work products. \\nUse of traceability typically improves the manage-\\nment of software work products and software pro-\\ncess quality; it also provides assurances to stake-\\nholders that all requirements have been satisfied. \\nTraceability enables change analysis once the soft-\\nware is developed and released, since relationships \\nto software work products can easily be traversed \\nto assess change impact. Modeling tools typically \\nprovide some automated or manual means to spec-\\nify and manage traceability links between require-\\nments, design, code, and/or test entities as may be \\nrepresented in the models and other software work \\nproducts. (For more information on traceability, \\nsee the Software Configuration Management KA).\\n3.5. Interaction\\u2008Analysis\\n[2*, c10, c11] [3*, c29s1.1, c29s5] [4*, c5]\\nInteraction analysis focuses on the communica -\\ntions or control flow relations between entities \\nused to accomplish a specific task or function \\nwithin the software model. This analysis exam -\\nines the dynamic behavior of the interactions \\nbetween different portions of the software model, \\nincluding other software layers (such as the oper-\\nating system, middleware, and applications). It \\nmay also be important for some software applica-\\ntions to examine interactions between the com -\\nputer software application and the user interface \\nsoftware. Some software modeling environments \\nprovide simulation facilities to study aspects of \\nthe dynamic behavior of modeled software. Step-\\nping through the simulation provides an analysis \\noption for the software engineer to review the \\ninteraction design and verify that the different \\nparts of the software work together to provide the \\nintended functions.')),\n",

Software Engineering Methods\\nSoftware engineering methods provide an orga -\\nnized and systematic approach to developing soft-\\nware for a target computer. There are numerous \\nmethods from which to choose, and it is important \\nfor the software engineer to choose an appropriate \\nmethod or methods for the software development \\ntask at hand; this choice can have a dramatic effect \\non the success of the software project. Use of these \\nsoftware engineering methods coupled with people \\nof the right skill set and tools enable the software \\nengineers to visualize the details of the software \\nand ultimately transform the representation into a \\nworking set of code and data.\\nSelected software engineering methods are dis-\\ncussed below. The topic areas are organized into \\ndiscussions of Heuristic Methods, Formal Meth -\\nods, Prototyping Methods, and Agile Methods.\\n4.1. Heuristic\\u2008Methods\\n[1*, c13, c15, c16] [3*, c2s2.2, c5s4.1, c7s1,]\\nHeuristic methods are those experience-based \\nsoftware engineering methods that have been and \\nare fairly widely practiced in the software indus -\\ntry. This topic area contains three broad discus -\\nsion categories: structured analysis and design \\nmethods, data modeling methods, and object-\\noriented analysis and design methods.\\n• Structured\\u2008Analysis\\u2008and\\u2008Design\\u2008Methods: \\nThe software model is developed primarily \\nfrom a functional or behavioral viewpoint, \\nstarting from a high-level view of the soft -\\nware (including data and control elements) \\nand then progressively decomposing or refin-\\ning the model components through increas -\\ningly detailed designs. The detailed design \\neventually converges to very specific details \\nor specifications of the software that must be \\ncoded (by hand, automatically generated, or \\nboth), built, tested, and verified.\\n• Data\\u2008Modeling\\u2008Methods: The data model is \\nconstructed from the viewpoint of the data or \\ninformation used. Data tables and relation -\\nships define the data models. This data mod-\\neling method is used primarily for defining \\nand analyzing data requirements supporting \\ndatabase designs or data repositories typi -\\ncally found in business software, where data \\nis actively managed as a business systems \\nresource or asset. \\n• Object-Oriented\\u2008Analysis\\u2008and\\u2008Design\\u2008Meth-\\nods: The object-oriented model is represented \\nas a collection of objects that encapsulate \\ndata and relationships and interact with other \\nobjects through methods. Objects may be \\nreal-world items or virtual items. The soft -\\nware model is constructed using diagrams \\nto constitute selected views of the software. \\nProgressive refinement of the software mod-\\nels leads to a detailed design. The detailed \\ndesign is then either evolved through suc -\\ncessive iteration or transformed (using some \\nmechanism) into the implementation view \\nof the model, where the code and packag -\\ning approach for eventual software product \\nrelease and deployment is expressed.\\n4.2. Formal\\u2008Methods\\n[1*, c18] [3*, c27] [5*, p8–24]\\nFormal methods are software engineering meth -\\nods used to specify, develop, and verify the soft -\\nware through application of a rigorous mathemat-\\nically based notation and language. Through use \\nof a specification language, the software model \\ncan be checked for consistency (in other words, \\nlack of ambiguity), completeness, and correctness \\nin a systematic and automated or semi-automated \\nfashion. This topic is related to the Formal Analy-\\nsis section in the Software Requirements KA. \\nThis section addresses specification languages, \\nprogram refinement and derivation, formal verifi-\\ncation, and logical inference.\\n• Specification\\u2008 Languages: Specification \\nlanguages provide the mathematical basis \\nfor a formal method; specification lan -\\nguages are formal, higher level computer \\nlanguages (in other words, not a classic \\n3rd Generation Language (3GL) program -\\nming language) used during the software \\nspecification, requirements analysis, and/\\nor design stages to describe specific input/\\noutput behavior. Specification languages are \\nnot directly executable languages; they are ')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 168}, page_content='9-8 SWEBOK® Guide V3.0\\ntypically comprised of a notation and syntax, \\nsemantics for use of the notation, and a set of \\nallowed relations for objects. \\n• Program\\u2008Refinement\\u2008and\\u2008Derivation: Pro -\\ngram refinement is the process of creating a \\nlower level (or more detailed) specification \\nusing a series of transformations. It is through \\nsuccessive transformations that the software \\nengineer derives an executable representation \\nof a program. Specifications may be refined, \\nadding details until the model can be formu-\\nlated in a 3GL programming language or in \\nan executable portion of the chosen specifica-\\ntion language. This specification refinement is \\nmade possible by defining specifications with \\nprecise semantic properties; the specifications \\nmust set out not only the relationships between \\nentities but also the exact runtime meanings of \\nthose relationships and operations.\\n• Formal\\u2008 Verification: Model checking is \\na formal verification method; it typically \\ninvolves performing a state-space explora -\\ntion or reachability analysis to demonstrate \\nthat the represented software design has or \\npreserves certain model properties of inter -\\nest. An example of model checking is an \\nanalysis that verifies correct program behav-\\nior under all possible interleaving of event or \\nmessage arrivals. The use of formal verifi -\\ncation requires a rigorously specified model \\nof the software and its operational environ -\\nment; this model often takes the form of a \\nfinite state machine or other formally defined \\nautomaton.\\n• Logical\\u2008Inference: Logical inference is a \\nmethod of designing software that involves \\nspecifying preconditions and postconditions \\naround each significant block of the design, \\nand—using mathematical logic—developing \\nthe proof that those preconditions and post -\\nconditions must hold under all inputs. This \\nprovides a way for the software engineer to \\npredict software behavior without having \\nto execute the software. Some Integrated \\nDevelopment Environments (IDEs) include \\nways to represent these proofs along with the \\ndesign or code.\\n4.3. Prototyping\\u2008Methods\\n[1*, c12s2] [3*, c2s3.1] [6*, c7s3p5]\\nSoftware prototyping is an activity that generally \\ncreates incomplete or minimally functional ver -\\nsions of a software application, usually for try -\\ning out specific new features, soliciting feedback \\non software requirements or user interfaces, fur -\\nther exploring software requirements, software \\ndesign, or implementation options, and/or gaining \\nsome other useful insight into the software. The \\nsoftware engineer selects a prototyping method to \\nunderstand the least understood aspects or com -\\nponents of the software first; this approach is in \\ncontrast with other software engineering methods \\nthat usually begin development with the most \\nunderstood portions first. Typically, the proto -\\ntyped product does not become the final software \\nproduct without extensive development rework \\nor refactoring.\\nThis section discusses prototyping styles, tar -\\ngets, and evaluation techniques in brief.\\n• Prototyping\\u2008Style: This addresses the various \\napproaches to developing prototypes. Proto -\\ntypes can be developed as throwaway code \\nor paper products, as an evolution of a work-\\ning design, or as an executable specification. \\nDifferent prototyping life cycle processes are \\ntypically used for each style. The style cho -\\nsen is based on the type of results the project \\nneeds, the quality of the results needed, and \\nthe urgency of the results.\\n• Prototyping\\u2008Target: The target of the pro -\\ntotype activity is the specific product being \\nserved by the prototyping effort. Examples \\nof prototyping targets include a requirements \\nspecification, an architectural design element \\nor component, an algorithm, or a human-\\nmachine user interface.\\n• Prototyping\\u2008Evaluation\\u2008Techniques: A pro -\\ntotype may be used or evaluated in a num -\\nber of ways by the software engineer or \\nother project stakeholders, driven primarily \\nby the underlying reasons that led to pro -\\ntotype development in the first place.

Agile\\u2008Methods\\u2008\\n[3*, c3] [6*, c7s3p7] [7*, c6, App. A]\\nAgile methods were born in the 1990s from the \\nneed to reduce the apparent large overhead associ-\\nated with heavyweight, plan-based methods used \\nin large-scale software-development projects. \\nAgile methods are considered lightweight meth -\\nods in that they are characterized by short, itera -\\ntive development cycles, self-organizing teams, \\nsimpler designs, code refactoring, test-driven \\ndevelopment, frequent customer involvement, and \\nan emphasis on creating a demonstrable working \\nproduct with each development cycle. \\nMany agile methods are available in the lit -\\nerature; some of the more popular approaches, \\nwhich are discussed here in brief, include Rapid \\nApplication Development (RAD), eXtreme Pro -\\ngramming (XP), Scrum, and Feature-Driven \\nDevelopment (FDD).\\n• RAD: Rapid software development methods \\nare used primarily in data-intensive, business-\\nsystems application development. The RAD \\nmethod is enabled with special-purpose data-\\nbase development tools used by software \\nengineers to quickly develop, test, and deploy \\nnew or modified business applications.\\n• XP: This approach uses stories or scenarios \\nfor requirements, develops tests first, has \\ndirect customer involvement on the team \\n(typically defining acceptance tests), uses \\npair programming, and provides for continu-\\nous code refactoring and integration. Stories \\nare decomposed into tasks, prioritized, esti -\\nmated, developed, and tested. Each incre -\\nment of software is tested with automated \\nand manual tests; an increment may be \\nreleased frequently, such as every couple of \\nweeks or so.\\n• Scrum: This agile approach is more project \\nmanagement-friendly than the others. The \\nscrum master manages the activities within \\nthe project increment; each increment is \\ncalled a sprint and lasts no more than 30 \\ndays. A Product Backlog Item (PBI) list is \\ndeveloped from which tasks are identified, \\ndefined, prioritized, and estimated. A work -\\ning version of the software is tested and \\nreleased in each increment. Daily scrum \\nmeetings ensure work is managed to plan.\\n• FDD:\\u2008This is a model-driven, short, itera -\\ntive software development approach using \\na five-phase process: (1) develop a product \\nmodel to scope the breadth of the domain, (2) \\ncreate the list of needs or features, (3) build \\nthe feature development plan, (4) develop \\ndesigns for iteration-specific features, and \\n(5) code, test, and then integrate the features. \\nFDD is similar to an incremental software \\ndevelopment approach; it is also similar to \\nXP, except that code ownership is assigned \\nto individuals rather than the team. FDD \\nemphasizes an overall architectural approach \\nto the software, which promotes building the \\nfeature correctly the first time rather than \\nemphasizing continual refactoring.\\nThere are many more variations of agile meth-\\nods in the literature and in practice. Note that \\nthere will always be a place for heavyweight, \\nplan-based software engineering methods as well \\nas places where agile methods shine. There are \\nnew methods arising from combinations of agile \\nand plan-based methods where practitioners are \\ndefining new methods that balance the features \\nneeded in both heavyweight and lightweight \\nmethods based primarily on prevailing organi -\\nzational business needs. These business needs, \\nas typically represented by some of the project \\nstakeholders, should and do drive the choice in \\nusing one software engineering method over \\nanother or in constructing a new method from the \\nbest features of a combination of software engi -\\nneering methods.')),\n",

Software quality may refer: to desir -\\nable characteristics of software products, to the \\nextent to which a particular software product pos-\\nsess those characteristics, and to processes, tools, \\nand techniques used to achieve those character -\\nistics. Over the years, authors and organizations \\nhave defined the term quality differently. To Phil \\nCrosby, it was “conformance to requirements” \\n[1]. Watts Humphrey refers to it as “achieving \\nexcellent levels of “fitness for use” [2].  Mean -\\nwhile, IBM coined the phrase “market-driven \\nquality,” where the “customer is the final arbiter” \\n[3*, p8].\\nMore recently, software quality is defined as the \\n“capability of software product to satisfy stated \\nand implied needs under specified conditions” [4] \\nand as “the degree to which a software product \\nmeets established requirements; however, quality \\ndepends upon the degree to which those estab -\\nlished requirements accurately represent stake -\\nholder needs, wants, and expectations” [5]. Both \\ndefinitions embrace the premise of conformance \\nto requirements. Neither refers to types of require-\\nments (e.g., functional, reliability, performance, \\ndependability, or any other characteristic). Signifi-\\ncantly, however, these definitions emphasize that \\nquality is dependent upon requirements.\\nThese definitions also illustrate another reason \\nfor the prevalence of software quality through -\\nout this Guide: a frequent ambiguity of software\\u2008\\nquality\\u2008 versus software\\u2008 quality\\u2008 requirements \\n(“the\\u2008-ilities” is a common shorthand). Software \\nquality requirements are actually attributes of (or \\nconstraints on) functional requirements (what \\nthe system does). Software requirements may \\nalso specify resource usage, a communication \\nprotocol, or many other characteristics. This KA \\nattempts clarity by using software\\u2008quality in the \\nbroadest sense from the definitions above and \\nby using software\\u2008quality\\u2008requirements as con -\\nstraints on functional requirements. Software \\nquality is achieved by conformance to all require-\\nments regardless of what characteristic is speci -\\nfied or how requirements are grouped or named.\\nSoftware quality is also considered in many of \\nthe SWEBOK KAs because it is a basic param -\\neter of a software engineering effort. For all engi-\\nneered products, the primary goal is delivering \\nmaximum stakeholder value, while balancing the \\nconstraints of development cost and schedule; \\nthis is sometimes characterized as “fitness for ')),\n",

For software products, stakeholders could \\nvalue price (what they pay for the product), lead \\ntime (how fast they get the product), and software \\nquality.\\nThis KA addresses definitions and provides an \\noverview of practices, tools, and techniques for \\ndefining software quality and for appraising the \\nstate of software quality during development, \\nmaintenance, and deployment. Cited references \\nprovide additional details.\\nBREAKDOWN OF TOPICS FOR \\nSOFTWARE QUALITY\\nThe breakdown of topics for the Software Quality \\nKA is presented in Figure 10.1.\\n1. Software Quality Fundamentals\\nReaching agreement on what constitutes quality \\nfor all stakeholders and clearly communicating \\nthat agreement to software engineers require that \\nthe many aspects of quality be formally defined \\nand discussed.\\nA software engineer should understand qual -\\nity concepts, characteristics, values, and their \\napplication to the software under development or \\nmaintenance. The important concept is that the \\nsoftware requirements define the required quality \\nattributes of the software. Software requirements \\ninfluence the measurement methods and accep -\\ntance criteria for assessing the degree to which \\nthe software and related documentation achieve \\nthe desired quality levels.\\n1.1. Software\\u2008Engineering\\u2008Culture\\u2008and\\u2008Ethics\\n[3*, c1s4] [6*, c2s3.5]\\nSoftware engineers are expected to share a com -\\nmitment to software quality as part of their culture. \\nA healthy software engineering culture includes \\nmany characteristics, including the understanding \\nthat tradeoffs among cost, schedule, and quality \\nare a basic tenant of the engineering of any prod-\\nuct. A strong software engineering ethic assumes \\nFigure 10.1. Breakdown of Topics for the Software Quality KA')),\n",

The IEEE Computer Society and the \\nACM have developed a code of ethics and pro -\\nfessional practice (see Codes of Ethics and Pro -\\nfessional Conduct in the Software Engineering \\nProfessional Practice KA).\\n1.2. Value\\u2008and\\u2008Costs\\u2008of\\u2008Quality\\n[7*, c17, c22]\\nDefining and then achieving software quality is \\nnot simple. Quality characteristics may or may \\nnot be required, or they may be required to a \\ngreater or lesser degree, and tradeoffs may be \\nmade among them. To help determine the level \\nof software quality, i.e., achieving stakeholder \\nvalue, this section presents cost of software qual-\\nity (CoSQ): a set of measurements derived from \\nthe economic assessment of software quality \\ndevelopment and maintenance processes. The \\nCoSQ measurements are examples of process \\nmeasurements that may be used to infer charac -\\nteristics of a product.\\nThe premise underlying the CoSQ is that the \\nlevel of quality in a software product can be \\ninferred from the cost of activities related to deal-\\ning with the consequences of poor quality. Poor \\nquality means that the software product does not \\nfully “satisfy stated and implied needs” or “estab-\\nlished requirements.” There are four cost of qual-\\nity categories: prevention, appraisal, internal fail-\\nure, and external failure.\\nPrevention costs include investments in software \\nprocess improvement efforts, quality infrastruc -\\nture, quality tools, training, audits, and manage -\\nment reviews. These costs are usually not specific \\nto a project; they span the organization. Appraisal \\ncosts arise from project activities that find defects. \\nThese appraisal activities can be categorized into \\ncosts of reviews (design, peer) and costs of test -\\ning (software unit testing, software integration, \\nsystem level testing, acceptance testing); appraisal \\ncosts would be extended to subcontracted software \\nsuppliers. Costs of internal failures are those that \\nare incurred to fix defects found during appraisal \\nactivities and discovered prior to delivery of the \\nsoftware product to the customer. External fail -\\nure costs include activities to respond to software \\nproblems discovered after delivery to the customer.\\nSoftware engineers should be able to use CoSQ \\nmethods to ascertain levels of software quality \\nand should also be able to present quality alter -\\nnatives and their costs so that tradeoffs between \\ncost, schedule, and delivery of stakeholder value \\ncan be made.\\n1.3. Models\\u2008and\\u2008Quality\\u2008Characteristics\\n[3*, c24s1] [7*, c2s4] [8*, c17]\\nTerminology for software quality characteristics \\ndiffers from one taxonomy (or model of software \\nquality) to another, each model perhaps having \\na different number of hierarchical levels and a \\ndifferent total number of characteristics. Various \\nauthors have produced models of software qual -\\nity characteristics or attributes that can be useful \\nfor discussing, planning, and rating the quality \\nof software products. ISO/IEC 25010: 2011 [4] \\ndefines product quality and quality in use as two \\nrelated quality models. Appendix B in the SWE-\\nBOK Guide provides a list of applicable standards \\nfor each KA. Standards for this KA cover various \\nways of characterizing software quality.\\n1.3.1. Software\\u2008Process\\u2008Quality\\nSoftware quality management and software engi-\\nneering process quality have a direct bearing on \\nthe quality of the software product.\\nModels and criteria that evaluate the capabili -\\nties of software organizations are primarily proj -\\nect organization and management considerations \\nand, as such, are covered in the Software Engi -\\nneering Management and Software Engineering \\nProcess KAs.\\nIt is not possible to completely distinguish pro-\\ncess quality from product quality because process \\noutcomes include products. Determining whether \\na process has the capability to consistently pro -\\nduce products of desired quality is not simple.\\nThe software engineering process, discussed \\nin the Software Engineering Process KA, influ -\\nences the quality characteristics of software prod-\\nucts, which in turn affect quality as perceived by \\nstakeholders.')),\n",

Software\\u2008Product\\u2008Quality\\nThe software engineer, first of all, must determine \\nthe real purpose of the software. In this regard, \\nstakeholder requirements are paramount, and they \\ninclude quality requirements in addition to func -\\ntional requirements. Thus, software engineers \\nhave a responsibility to elicit quality requirements \\nthat may not be explicit at the outset and to under-\\nstand their importance as well as the level of diffi-\\nculty in attaining them. All software development \\nprocesses (e.g., eliciting requirements, designing, \\nconstructing, building, checking, improving qual-\\nity) are designed with these quality requirements \\nin mind and may carry additional development \\ncosts if attributes such as safety, security, and \\ndependability are important. The additional devel-\\nopment costs help ensure that quality obtained can \\nbe traded off against the anticipated benefits.\\nThe term work-product means any artifact that \\nis the outcome of a process used to create the \\nfinal software product. Examples of a work-prod-\\nuct include a system/subsystem specification, a \\nsoftware requirements specification for a soft -\\nware component of a system, a software design \\ndescription, source code, software test documen -\\ntation, or reports. While some treatments of qual-\\nity are described in terms of final software and \\nsystem performance, sound engineering practice \\nrequires that intermediate work-products relevant \\nto quality be evaluated throughout the software \\nengineering process.\\n1.4. Software\\u2008Quality\\u2008Improvement\\n[3*, c1s4] [9*, c24] [10*, c11s2.4]\\nThe quality of software products can be improved \\nthrough preventative processes or an itera -\\ntive process of continual improvement, which \\nrequires management control, coordination, and \\nfeedback from many concurrent processes: (1) \\nthe software life cycle processes, (2) the process \\nof fault/defect detection, removal, and preven -\\ntion, and (3) the quality improvement process.\\nThe theory and concepts behind qual -\\nity improvement—such as building in quality \\nthrough the prevention and early detection of \\ndefects, continual improvement, and stakeholder \\nfocus—are pertinent to software engineering. \\nThese concepts are based on the work of experts \\nin quality who have stated that the quality of a \\nproduct is directly linked to the quality of the \\nprocess used to create it. Approaches such as the \\nDeming improvement cycle of Plan-Do-Check-\\nAct (PDCA), evolutionary delivery, kaizen, and \\nquality function deployment (QFD) offer tech -\\nniques to specify quality objectives and determine \\nwhether they are met. The Software Engineering \\nInstitute’s IDEAL is another method [7*]. Qual -\\nity management is now recognized by the SWE-\\nBOK Guide as an important discipline.\\nManagement sponsorship supports process and \\nproduct evaluations and the resulting findings. \\nThen an improvement program is developed \\nidentifying detailed actions and improvement \\nprojects to be addressed in a feasible time frame. \\nManagement support implies that each improve -\\nment project has enough resources to achieve the \\ngoal defined for it. Management sponsorship is \\nsolicited frequently by implementing proactive \\ncommunication activities.\\n1.5. Software\\u2008Safety\\u2008\\n[9*, c11s3]\\nSafety-critical systems are those in which a sys -\\ntem failure could harm human life, other living \\nthings, physical structures, or the environment. \\nThe software in these systems is safety-critical. \\nThere are increasing numbers of applications \\nof safety-critical software in a growing number \\nof industries. Examples of systems with safety-\\ncritical software include mass transit systems, \\nchemical manufacturing plants, and medical \\ndevices. The failure of software in these systems \\ncould have catastrophic effects. There are indus -\\ntry standards, such as DO-178C [11], and emerg-\\ning processes, tools, and techniques for develop -\\ning safetycritical software. The intent of these \\nstandards, tools, and techniques is to reduce the \\nrisk of injecting faults into the software and thus \\nimprove software reliability.\\nSafety-critical software can be categorized as \\ndirect or indirect. Direct is that software embed -\\nded in a safety-critical system, such as the flight \\ncontrol computer of an aircraft. Indirect includes \\nsoftware applications used to develop safety-\\ncritical software. Indirect software is included in \\nsoftware engineering environments and software \\ntest environments.')),\n",

These \\ntechniques impact software functional require -\\nments, software performance requirements, and \\ndevelopment processes. Increasing levels of risk \\nimply increasing levels of software quality assur-\\nance and control techniques such as inspections. \\nHigher risk levels may necessitate more thorough \\ninspections of requirements, design, and code \\nor the use of more formal analytical techniques. \\nAnother technique for managing and control -\\nling software risk is building assurance cases. An \\nassurance case is a reasoned, auditable artifact \\ncreated to support the contention that its claim \\nor claims are satisfied. It contains the following \\nand their relationships: one or more claims about \\nproperties; arguments that logically link the evi -\\ndence and any assumptions to the claims; and a \\nbody of evidence and assumptions supporting \\nthese arguments [12].\\n2. Software Quality Management Processes\\nSoftware quality management is the collection of \\nall processes that ensure that software products, \\nservices, and life cycle process implementations \\nmeet organizational software quality objectives \\nand achieve stakeholder satisfaction [13, 14]. \\nSQM defines processes, process owners, require-\\nments for the processes, measurements of the \\nprocesses and their outputs, and feedback chan -\\nnels throughout the whole software life cycle.\\nSQM comprises four subcategories: software \\nquality planning, software quality assurance \\n(SQA), software quality control (SQC), and soft-\\nware process improvement (SPI). Software qual-\\nity planning includes determining which quality \\nstandards are to be used, defining specific quality \\ngoals, and estimating the effort and schedule of \\nsoftware quality activities. In some cases, soft -\\nware quality planning also includes defining the \\nsoftware quality processes to be used. SQA activ-\\nities define and assess the adequacy of software \\nprocesses to provide evidence that establishes \\nconfidence that the software processes are appro-\\npriate for and produce software products of suit -\\nable quality for their intended purposes [5]. SQC \\nactivities examine specific project artifacts (docu-\\nments and executables) to determine whether they \\ncomply with standards established for the project \\n(including requirements, constraints, designs, \\ncontracts, and plans). SQC evaluates intermedi -\\nate products as well as the final products.\\nThe fourth SQM category dealing with improve-\\nment has various names within the software indus-\\ntry, including SPI, software quality improvement, \\nand software corrective and preventive action. The \\nactivities in this category seek to improve process \\neffectiveness, efficiency, and other characteris -\\ntics with the ultimate goal of improving software \\nquality. Although SPI could be included in any of \\nthe first three categories, an increasing number \\nof organizations organize SPI into a separate cat-\\negory that may span across many projects (see the \\nSoftware Engineering Process KA).\\nSoftware quality processes consist of tasks \\nand techniques to indicate how software plans \\n(e.g., software management, development, qual -\\nity management, or configuration management \\nplans) are being implemented and how well the \\nintermediate and final products are meeting their \\nspecified requirements. Results from these tasks \\nare assembled in reports for management before \\ncorrective action is taken. The management of \\nan SQM process is tasked with ensuring that the \\nresults of these reports are accurate.\\nRisk management can also play an important \\nrole in delivering quality software. Incorporating \\ndisciplined risk analysis and management tech -\\nniques into the software life cycle processes can \\nhelp improve product quality (see the Software \\nEngineering Management KA for related mate -\\nrial on risk management).\\n2.1. Software\\u2008Quality\\u2008Assurance\\n[7*, c4–c6, c11, c12, c26–27]\\nTo quell a widespread misunderstanding, soft -\\nware quality assurance is not testing. software \\nquality assurance (SQA) is a set of activities that \\ndefine and assess the adequacy of software pro -\\ncesses to provide evidence that establishes confi-\\ndence that the software processes are appropriate \\nand produce software products of suitable qual -\\nity for their intended purposes. A key attribute of \\nSQA is the objectivity of the SQA function with \\nrespect to the project. The SQA function may \\nalso be organizationally independent of the proj -\\nect; that is, free from technical, managerial, and ')),\n",

SQA has \\ntwo aspects: product assurance and process assur-\\nance, which are explained in section 2.3. \\nThe software quality plan (in some industry \\nsectors it is termed the software quality assurance \\nplan) defines the activities and tasks employed \\nto ensure that software developed for a specific \\nproduct satisfies the project’s established require-\\nments and user needs within project cost and \\nschedule constraints and is commensurate with \\nproject risks. The SQAP first ensures that quality \\ntargets are clearly defined and understood.\\nThe SQA plan’s quality activities and tasks are \\nspecified with their costs, resource requirements, \\nobjectives, and schedule in relation to related \\nobjectives in the software engineering manage -\\nment, software development, and software main-\\ntenance plans. The SQA plan should be consis -\\ntent with the software configuration management \\nplan (see the Software Configuration Manage -\\nment KA). The SQA plan identifies documents, \\nstandards, practices, and conventions governing \\nthe project and how these items are checked and \\nmonitored to ensure adequacy and compliance. \\nThe SQA plan also identifies measures; statistical \\ntechniques; procedures for problem reporting and \\ncorrective action; resources such as tools, tech -\\nniques, and methodologies; security for physical \\nmedia; training; and SQA reporting and docu -\\nmentation. Moreover, the SQA plan addresses \\nthe software quality assurance activities of any \\nother type of activity described in the software \\nplans—such as procurement of supplier software \\nfor the project, commercial off-the-shelf software \\n(COTS) installation, and service after delivery of \\nthe software. It can also contain acceptance crite-\\nria as well as reporting and management activi -\\nties that are critical to software quality.\\n2.2. Verification\\u2008&\\u2008Validation\\n[9*, c2s2.3, c8, c15s1.1, c21s3.3]\\nAs stated in [15], \\nThe purpose of V&V is to help the devel -\\nopment organization build quality into the \\nsystem during the life cycle. V&V pro -\\ncesses provide an objective assessment \\nof products and processes throughout the \\nlife cycle. This assessment demonstrates \\nwhether the requirements are correct, com-\\nplete, accurate, consistent, and testable. \\nThe V&V processes determine whether \\nthe development products of a given activ-\\nity conform to the requirements of that \\nactivity and whether the product satisfies \\nits intended use and user needs.\\nVerification is an attempt to ensure that the \\nproduct is built correctly, in the sense that the \\noutput products of an activity meet the specifi -\\ncations imposed on them in previous activities. \\nValidation is an attempt to ensure that the right \\nproduct is built—that is, the product fulfills its \\nspecific intended purpose. Both the verification \\nprocess and the validation process begin early \\nin the development or maintenance phase. They \\nprovide an examination of key product features \\nin relation to both the product’s immediate prede-\\ncessor and the specifications to be met.\\nThe purpose of planning V&V is to ensure that \\neach resource, role, and responsibility is clearly \\nassigned. The resulting V&V plan documents \\ndescribe the various resources and their roles and \\nactivities, as well as the techniques and tools to be \\nused. An understanding of the different purposes of \\neach V&V activity helps in the careful planning of \\nthe techniques and resources needed to fulfill their \\npurposes. The plan also addresses the manage -\\nment, communication, policies, and procedures of \\nthe V&V activities and their interaction, as well as \\ndefect reporting and documentation requirements.\\n2.3. Reviews\\u2008and\\u2008Audits\\n[9*, c24s3] [16*]\\nReviews and audit processes are broadly defined \\nas static—meaning that no software programs or \\nmodels are executed—examination of software \\nengineering artifacts with respect to standards that \\nhave been established by the organization or proj-\\nect for those artifacts. Different types of reviews \\nand audits are distinguished by their purpose, lev-\\nels of independence, tools and techniques, roles, \\nand by the subject of the activity.

Management\\u2008Reviews\\nAs stated in [16*],\\nThe purpose of a management review is to \\nmonitor progress, determine the status of \\nplans and schedules, and evaluate the effec-\\ntiveness of management processes, tools \\nand techniques. Management reviews com-\\npare actual project results against plans to \\ndetermine the status of projects or mainte-\\nnance efforts. The main parameters of man-\\nagement reviews are project cost, schedule, \\nscope, and quality. Management reviews \\nevaluate decisions about corrective actions, \\nchanges in the allocation of resources, or \\nchanges to the scope of the project.\\nInputs to management reviews may include \\naudit reports, progress reports, V&V reports, and \\nplans of many types, including risk management, \\nproject management, software configuration \\nmanagement, software safety, and risk assess -\\nment, among others. (Refer to the Software Engi-\\nneering Management and the Software Configu -\\nration Management KAs for related material.)\\n2.3.2. Technical\\u2008Reviews\\nAs stated in [16*],\\nThe purpose of a technical review is to \\nevaluate a software product by a team of \\nqualified personnel to determine its suit -\\nability for its intended use and identify \\ndiscrepancies from specifications and \\nstandards. It provides management with \\nevidence to confirm the technical status of \\nthe project. \\nAlthough any work-product can be reviewed, \\ntechnical reviews are performed on the main \\nsoftware engineering work-products of software \\nrequirements and software design.\\nPurpose, roles, activities, and most importantly \\nthe level of formality distinguish different types \\nof technical reviews. Inspections are the most for-\\nmal, walkthroughs less, and pair reviews or desk \\nchecks are the least formal.\\nExamples of specific roles include a decision \\nmaker (i.e., software lead), a review leader, a \\nrecorder, and checkers (technical staff members \\nwho examine the work-products). Reviews are \\nalso distinguished by whether meetings (face to \\nface or electronic) are included in the process. In \\nsome review methods checkers solitarily exam -\\nine work-products and send their results back to \\na coordinator. In other methods checkers work \\ncooperatively in meetings. A technical review \\nmay require that mandatory inputs be in place in \\norder to proceed:\\n• Statement of objectives\\n• Specific software product\\n• Specific project management plan\\n• Issues list associated with this product\\n• Technical review procedure.\\nThe team follows the documented review pro -\\ncedure. The technical review is completed once \\nall the activities listed in the examination have \\nbeen completed.\\nTechnical reviews of source code may include a \\nwide variety of concerns such as analysis of algo-\\nrithms, utilization of critical computer resources, \\nadherence to coding standards, structure and ')),\n",

Inspections\\n“The purpose of an inspection is to detect and \\nidentify software product anomalies” [16*]. \\nSome important differentiators of inspections as \\ncompared to other types of technical reviews are \\nthese:\\n1. Rules. Inspections are based upon examining \\na work-product with respect to a defined set \\nof criteria specified by the organization. Sets \\nof rules can be defined for different types of \\nworkproducts (e.g., rules for requirements, \\narchitecture descriptions, source code).\\n2. Sampling. Rather that attempt to examine \\nevery word and figure in a document, the \\ninspection process allows checkers to evalu-\\nate defined subsets (samples) of the docu -\\nments under review.\\n3. Peer. Individuals holding management posi -\\ntions over members of the inspection team \\ndo not participate in the inspection. This is \\na key distinction between peer review and \\nmanagement review.\\n4. Led. An impartial moderator who is trained \\nin inspection techniques leads inspection \\nmeetings.\\n5. Meeting. The inspection process includes \\nmeetings (face to face or electronic) con -\\nducted by a moderator according to a formal \\nprocedure in which inspection team mem -\\nbers report the anomalies they have found \\nand other issues.\\nSoftware inspections always involve the author \\nof an intermediate or final product; other reviews \\nmight not. Inspections also include an inspection \\nleader, a recorder, a reader, and a few (two to five) \\ncheckers (inspectors). The members of an inspec-\\ntion team may possess different expertise, such as \\ndomain expertise, software design method exper-\\ntise, or programming language expertise. Inspec-\\ntions are usually conducted on one relatively \\nsmall section of the product at a time (samples). \\nEach team member examines the software prod -\\nuct and other review inputs prior to the review \\nmeeting, perhaps by applying an analytical tech -\\nnique (see section 3.3.3) to a small section of \\nthe product or to the entire product with a focus \\non only one aspect—e.g., interfaces. During the \\ninspection, the moderator conducts the session \\nand verifies that everyone has prepared for the \\ninspection and conducts the session. The inspec -\\ntion recorder documents anomalies found. A set \\nof rules, with criteria and questions germane to \\nthe issues of interest, is a common tool used in \\ninspections. The resulting list often classifies the \\nanomalies (see section 3.2, Defect Characteriza -\\ntion) and is reviewed for completeness and accu-\\nracy by the team. The inspection exit decision \\ncorresponds to one of the following options:\\n1. Accept with no or, at most, minor reworking\\n2. Accept with rework verification\\n3. Reinspect.\\n2.3.4. Walkthroughs\\nAs stated in [16*],\\nThe purpose of a systematic walk-through \\nis to evaluate a software product. A walk-\\nthrough may be conducted for the purpose \\nof educating an audience regarding a soft-\\nware product. \\nWalkthroughs are distinguished from inspec -\\ntions. The main difference is that the author pres-\\nents the work-product to the other participants in \\na meeting (face to face or electronic). Unlike an \\ninspection, the meeting participants may not have \\nnecessarily seen the material prior to the meet -\\ning. The meetings may be conducted less for -\\nmally. The author takes the role of explaining and \\nshowing the material to participants and solicits \\nfeedback. Like inspections, walkthroughs may be \\nconducted on any type of work-product including \\nproject plan, requirements, design, source code, \\nand test reports.')),\n",

Process\\u2008Assurance\\u2008and\\u2008Product\\u2008Assur-\\nance\\u2008Audits\\nAs stated in [16*], \\nThe purpose of a software audit is to pro -\\nvide an independent evaluation of the con-\\nformance of software products and pro -\\ncesses to applicable regulations, standards, \\nguidelines, plans, and procedures. \\nProcess assurance audits determine the adequacy \\nof plans, schedules, and requirements to achieve \\nproject objectives [5]. The audit is a formally \\norganized activity with participants having spe -\\ncific roles—such as lead auditor, another auditor, a \\nrecorder, or an initiator—and including a represen-\\ntative of the audited organization. Audits identify \\ninstances of nonconformance and produce a report \\nrequiring the team to take corrective action.\\nWhile there may be many formal names for \\nreviews and audits, such as those identified in the \\nstandard [16*], the important point is that they \\ncan occur on almost any product at any stage of \\nthe development or maintenance process.\\n3. Practical Considerations\\n3.1. Software\\u2008Quality\\u2008Requirements\\n[9*, c11s1] [18*, c12]\\n [17*, c15s3.2.2, c15s3.3.1, c16s9.10]\\n3.1.1. Influence\\u2008Factors\\nVarious factors influence planning, management, \\nand selection of SQM activities and techniques, \\nincluding\\n• the domain of the system in which the soft -\\nware resides; the system functions could be \\nsafety-critical, mission-critical, business-\\ncritical, security-critical\\n• the physical environment in which the soft -\\nware system resides\\n• system and software functional (what the \\nsystem does) and quality (how well the sys -\\ntem performs its functions) requirements\\n• the commercial (external) or standard (inter-\\nnal) components to be used in the system\\n• the specific software engineering standards \\napplicable\\n• the methods and software tools to be used for \\ndevelopment and maintenance and for qual -\\nity evaluation and improvement\\n• the budget, staff, project organization, plans, \\nand scheduling of all processes\\n• the intended users and use of the system\\n• the integrity level of the system.\\nInformation on these factors influences how \\nthe SQM processes are organized and docu -\\nmented, how specific SQM activities are selected, \\nwhat resources are needed, and which of those \\nresources impose bounds on the efforts.\\n3.1.2. Dependability\\nIn cases where system failure may have extremely \\nsevere consequences, overall dependability (hard-\\nware, software, and human or operational) is the \\nmain quality requirement over and above basic \\nfunctionality. This is the case for the following \\nreasons: system failures affect a large number of \\npeople; users often reject systems that are unre -\\nliable, unsafe, or insecure; system failure costs \\nmay be enormous; and undependable systems \\nmay cause information loss. System and soft -\\nware dependability include such characteristics \\nas availability, reliability, safety, and security. \\nWhen developing dependable software, tools and \\ntechniques can be applied to reduce the risk of \\ninjecting faults into the intermediate deliverables \\nor the final software product. Verification, valida-\\ntion, and testing processes, techniques, methods, \\nand tools identify faults that impact dependability \\nas early as possible in the life cycle. Addition -\\nally, mechanisms may need to be in place in the \\nsoftware to guard against external attacks and to \\ntolerate faults.\\n3.1.3. Integrity\\u2008Levels\\u2008of\\u2008Software\\nDefining integrity levels is a method of risk \\nmanagement. \\nSoftware integrity levels are a range of \\nvalues that represent software complexity, \\ncriticality, risk, safety level, security level, ')),\n",

The characteristics used to \\ndetermine software integrity level vary \\ndepending on the intended application and \\nuse of the system. The software is a part of \\nthe system, and its integrity level is to be \\ndetermined as a part of that system.\\nThe assigned software integrity levels may \\nchange as the software evolves. Design, coding, \\nprocedural, and technology features implemented \\nin the system or software can raise or lower the \\nassigned software integrity levels. The software \\nintegrity levels established for a project result \\nfrom agreements among the acquirer, supplier, \\ndeveloper, and independent assurance authorities. \\nA software integrity level scheme is a tool used in \\ndetermining software integrity levels. [5]\\nAs noted in [17*], “the integrity levels can be \\napplied during development to allocate additional \\nverification and validation efforts to high-integ -\\nrity components.”\\n3.2. Defect\\u2008Characterization\\n[3*, c3s3, c8s8, c10s2]\\nSoftware quality evaluation (i.e., software quality \\ncontrol) techniques find defects, faults and fail -\\nures. Characterizing these techniques leads to an \\nunderstanding of the product, facilitates correc -\\ntions to the process or the product, and informs \\nmanagement and other stakeholders of the sta -\\ntus of the process or product. Many taxonomies \\nexist and, while attempts have been made to gain \\nconsensus, the literature indicates that there are \\nquite a few in use. Defect characterization is also \\nused in audits and reviews, with the review leader \\noften presenting a list of issues provided by team \\nmembers for consideration at a review meeting.\\nAs new design methods and languages evolve, \\nalong with advances in overall software technolo-\\ngies, new classes of defects appear, and a great \\ndeal of effort is required to interpret previously \\ndefined classes. When tracking defects, the soft -\\nware engineer is interested in not only the number \\nof defects but also the types. Information alone, \\nwithout some classification, may not be sufficient \\nto identify the underlying causes of the defects. \\nSpecific types of problems need to be grouped to \\nidentify trends over time. The point is to establish \\na defect taxonomy that is meaningful to the orga-\\nnization and to software engineers.\\nSoftware quality control activities discover infor-\\nmation at all stages of software development and \\nmaintenance. In some cases, the word defect is \\noverloaded to refer to different types of anomalies. \\nHowever, different engineering cultures and stan-\\ndards may use somewhat different meanings for \\nthese terms. The variety of terms prompts this sec-\\ntion to provide a widely used set of definitions [19]:\\n• Computational\\u2008 Error: “the difference \\nbetween a computed, observed, or measured \\nvalue or condition and the true, specified, or \\ntheoretically correct value or condition.”\\n• Error: “A human action that produces an \\nincorrect result.” A slip or mistake that a per-\\nson makes. Also called human error.\\n• Defect: An “imperfection or deficiency in a \\nwork product where that work product does \\nnot meet its requirements or specifications \\nand needs to be either repaired or replaced.” \\nA defect is caused by a person committing \\nan error.\\n• Fault: A defect in source code. An “incorrect \\nstep, process, or data definition in computer \\nprogram.” The encoding of a human error in \\nsource code. Fault is the formal name of a bug.\\n• Failure: An “event in which a system or sys-\\ntem component does not perform a required \\nfunction within specified limits.” A failure is \\nproduced when a fault is encountered by the \\nprocessor under specified conditions.\\nUsing these definitions three widely used soft -\\nware quality measurements are defect density \\n(number of defects per unit size of documents), \\nfault density (number of faults per 1K lines of \\ncode), and failure intensity (failures per use-hour \\nor per test-hour). Reliability models are built \\nfrom failure data collected during software test -\\ning or from software in service and thus can be \\nused to estimate the probability of future failures \\nand to assist in decisions on when to stop testing.\\nOne probable action resulting from SQM find -\\nings is to remove the defects from the product \\nunder examination (e.g., find and fix bugs, create \\nnew build). Other activities attempt to eliminate ')),\n",

RCA activities include analyzing \\nand summarizing the findings to find root causes \\nand using measurement techniques to improve \\nthe product and the process as well as to track the \\ndefects and their removal. Process improvement \\nis primarily discussed in the Software Engineer -\\ning Process KA, with the SQM process being a \\nsource of information.\\nData on inadequacies and defects found by \\nsoftware quality control techniques may be lost \\nunless they are recorded. For some techniques \\n(e.g., technical reviews, audits, inspections), \\nrecorders are present to set down such informa -\\ntion, along with issues and decisions. When auto-\\nmated tools are used (see topic 4, Software Qual-\\nity Tools), the tool output may provide the defect \\ninformation. Reports about defects are provided \\nto the management of the organization.\\n3.3. Software\\u2008Quality\\u2008Management\\u2008Techniques\\n[7*, c7s3] [8*, c17] [9*, c12s5, c15s1, p417] \\n[16*] \\nSoftware quality control techniques can be cat -\\negorized in many ways, but a straightforward \\napproach uses just two categories: static and \\ndynamic. Dynamic techniques involve executing \\nthe software; static techniques involve analyzing \\ndocuments and source code but not executing the \\nsoftware.\\n3.3.1. Static\\u2008Techniques\\nStatic techniques examine software documenta -\\ntion (including requirements, interface specifica -\\ntions, designs, and models) and software source \\ncode without executing the code. There are many \\ntools and techniques for statically examining soft-\\nware work-products (see section 2.3.2). In addi -\\ntion, tools that analyze source code control flow \\nand search for dead code are considered to be \\nstatic analysis tools because they do not involve \\nexecuting the software code.\\nOther, more formal, types of analytical tech -\\nniques are known as formal methods . They are \\nnotably used to verify software requirements and \\ndesigns. They have mostly been used in the veri-\\nfication of crucial parts of critical systems, such \\nas specific security and safety requirements. (See \\nalso Formal Methods in the Software Engineer -\\ning Models and Methods KA.)\\n3.3.2. Dynamic\\u2008Techniques\\nDynamic techniques involve executing the soft -\\nware code. Different kinds of dynamic techniques \\nare performed throughout the development and \\nmaintenance of software. Generally, these are \\ntesting techniques, but techniques such as simu -\\nlation and model analysis may be considered \\ndynamic (see the Software Engineering Models \\nand Methods KA). Code reading is considered a \\nstatic technique, but experienced software engi -\\nneers may execute the code as they read through \\nit. Code reading may utilize dynamic techniques. \\nThis discrepancy in categorizing indicates that \\npeople with different roles and experience in the \\norganization may consider and apply these tech -\\nniques differently.\\nDifferent groups may perform testing during \\nsoftware development, including groups inde -\\npendent of the development team. The Software \\nTesting KA is devoted entirely to this subject.\\n3.3.3. Testing\\nTwo types of testing may fall under V&V because \\nof their responsibility for the quality of the mate-\\nrials used in the project:\\n• Evaluation and tests of tools to be used on \\nthe project\\n• Conformance tests (or review of confor -\\nmance tests) of components and COTS prod-\\nucts to be used in the product.\\nSometimes an independent (third-party or \\nIV&V) organization may be tasked to perform \\ntesting or to monitor the test process V&V may \\nbe called upon to evaluate the testing itself: ade -\\nquacy of plans, processes, and procedures, and \\nadequacy and accuracy of results.\\nThe third party is not the developer, nor is it \\nassociated with the development of the product. \\nInstead, the third party is an independent facil -\\nity, usually accredited by some body of authority. \\nTheir purpose is to test a product for conformance \\nto a specific set of requirements (see the Software \\nTesting KA).')),\n",

Software\\u2008Quality\\u2008Measurement\\n[3*, c4] [8*, c17] [9*, p90]\\nSoftware quality measurements are used to \\nsupport decision-making. With the increasing \\nsophistication of software, questions of quality \\ngo beyond whether or not the software works to \\nhow well it achieves measurable quality goals.\\nDecisions supported by software quality mea -\\nsurement include determining levels of software \\nquality (notably because models of software \\nproduct quality include measures to determine \\nthe degree to which the software product achieves \\nquality goals); managerial questions about effort, \\ncost, and schedule; determining when to stop test-\\ning and release a product (see Termination under \\nsection 5.1, Practical Considerations, in the Soft-\\nware Testing KA); and determining the efficacy \\nof process improvement efforts.\\nThe cost of SQM processes is an issue fre -\\nquently raised in deciding how a project or a soft-\\nware development and maintenance group should \\nbe organized. Often, generic models of cost are \\nused, which are based on when a defect is found \\nand how much effort it takes to fix the defect rela-\\ntive to finding the defect earlier in the develop -\\nment process. Software quality measurement data \\ncollected internally may give a better picture of \\ncost within this project or organization.\\nWhile the software quality measurement data \\nmay be useful in itself (e.g., the number of defec-\\ntive requirements or the proportion of defective \\nrequirements), mathematical and graphical tech -\\nniques can be applied to aid in the interpretation \\nof the measures (see the Engineering Foundations \\nKA). These techniques include\\n• descriptive statistics based (e.g., Pareto \\nanalysis, run charts, scatter plots, normal \\ndistribution)\\n• statistical tests (e.g., the binomial test, chi-\\nsquared test)\\n• trend analysis (e.g., control charts; see \\nThe\\u2008Quality\\u2008Toolbox in the list of further \\nreadings)\\n• prediction (e.g., reliability models).\\nDescriptive statistics-based techniques and \\ntests often provide a snapshot of the more \\ntroublesome areas of the software product under \\nexamination. The resulting charts and graphs \\nare visualization aids, which the decision mak -\\ners can use to focus resources and conduct pro -\\ncess improvements where they appear to be most \\nneeded. Results from trend analysis may indicate \\nthat a schedule is being met, such as in testing, or \\nthat certain classes of faults may become more \\nlikely to occur unless some corrective action is \\ntaken in development. The predictive techniques \\nassist in estimating testing effort and schedule \\nand in predicting failures. More discussion on \\nmeasurement in general appears in the Software \\nEngineering Process and Software Engineering \\nManagement KAs. More specific information on \\ntesting measurement is presented in the Software \\nTesting KA.\\nSoftware quality measurement includes mea -\\nsuring defect occurrences and applying statistical \\nmethods to understand the types of defects that \\noccur most frequently. This information may be \\nused by software process improvement for deter-\\nmining methods to prevent, reduce, or eliminate \\ntheir recurrence. They also aid in understanding \\ntrends, how well detection and containment tech-\\nniques are working, and how well the develop -\\nment and maintenance processes are progressing.\\nFrom these measurement methods, defect \\nprofiles can be developed for a specific applica -\\ntion domain. Then, for the next software project \\nwithin that organization, the profiles can be used \\nto guide the SQM processes—that is, to expend \\nthe effort where problems are most likely to occur. \\nSimilarly, benchmarks, or defect counts typical of \\nthat domain, may serve as one aid in determining \\nwhen the product is ready for delivery. Discus -\\nsion on using data from SQM to improve devel -\\nopment and maintenance processes appears in the \\nSoftware Engineering Management and Software \\nEngineering Process KAs.\\n4. Software Quality Tools\\nSoftware quality tools include static and dynamic \\nanalysis tools. Static analysis tools input source \\ncode, perform syntactical and semantic analysis \\nwithout executing the code, and present results to \\nusers. There is a large variety in the depth, thor -\\noughness, and scope of static analysis tools that ')),\n",

(See the Software Con -\\nstruction, Software Testing, and Software Main -\\ntenance KAs for descriptions of dynamic analysis \\ntools.)\\nCategories of static analysis tools include the \\nfollowing:\\n• Tools that facilitate and partially automate \\nreviews and inspections of documents and \\ncode. These tools can route work to differ -\\nent participants in order to partially automate \\nand control a review process. They allow \\nusers to enter defects found during inspec -\\ntions and reviews for later removal.\\n• Some tools help organizations perform soft -\\nware safety hazard analysis. These tools \\nprovide, e.g., automated support for failure \\nmode and effects analysis (FMEA) and fault \\ntree analysis (FTA).\\n• Tools that support tracking of software prob-\\nlems provide for entry of anomalies discov -\\nered during software testing and subsequent \\nanalysis, disposition, and resolution. Some \\ntools include support for workflow and for \\ntracking the status of problem resolution.\\n• Tools that analyze data captured from soft -\\nware engineering environments and soft -\\nware test environments and produce visual \\ndisplays of quantified data in the form of \\ngraphs, charts, and tables. These tools some-\\ntimes include the functionality to perform \\nstatistical analysis on data sets (for the pur -\\npose of discerning trends and making fore -\\ncasts).

Because of the widespread applica -\\ntions of software products in social and personal \\nlife, the quality of software products can have \\nprofound impact on our personal well-being \\nand societal harmony. Software engineers must \\nhandle unique engineering problems, producing \\nsoftware with known characteristics and reliabil -\\nity. This requirement calls for software engineers \\nwho possess a proper set of knowledge, skills, \\ntraining, and experience in professional practice. \\nThe term “professional practice” refers to a \\nway of conducting services so as to achieve cer -\\ntain standards or criteria in both the process of \\nperforming a service and the end product result -\\ning from the service. These standards and crite -\\nria can include both technical and nontechnical \\naspects. The concept of professional practice can \\nbe viewed as being more applicable within those \\nprofessions that have a generally accepted body \\nof knowledge; codes of ethics and professional \\nconduct with penalties for violations; accepted \\nprocesses for accreditation, certification, and \\nlicensing; and professional societies to provide \\nand administer all of these. Admission to these \\nprofessional societies is often predicated on a pre-\\nscribed combination of education and experience.\\nA software engineer maintains a professional \\npractice by performing all work in accordance \\nwith generally accepted practices, standards, and \\nguidelines notably set forth by the applicable pro-\\nfessional society. For example, the Association for \\nComputing Machinery (ACM) and IEEE Com -\\nputer Society (IEEE CS) have established a Soft-\\nware Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional \\nPractice. Both the British Computer Society (BCS) \\nand the International Federation for Information \\nProcessing (IFIP) have established similar profes-\\nsional practice standards. ISO/IEC and IEEE have \\nfurther provided internationally accepted software \\nengineering standards (see Appendix B of this \\nGuide). IEEE CS has established two international \\ncertification programs (CSDA, CSDP) and a corre-\\nsponding Guide\\u2008to\\u2008the\\u2008Software\\u2008Engineering\\u2008Body\\u2008\\nof\\u2008Knowledge\\u2008(SWEBOK Guide).

Those criteria form the basis \\nfor accreditation and licensing activities and may \\nbe used as a measure to determine engineering \\ncompetence or negligence.\\n1.1. Accreditation,\\u2008Certification,\\u2008and\\u2008Licensing\\n[1*, c1s4.1, c1s5.1–c1s5.4]\\n1.1.1. Accreditation\\u2008\\nAccreditation is a process to certify the compe -\\ntency, authority, or credibility of an organization. \\nAccredited schools or programs are assured to \\nadhere to particular standards and maintain cer -\\ntain qualities. In many countries, the basic means \\nby which engineers acquire knowledge is through \\ncompletion of an accredited course of study. \\nOften, engineering accreditation is performed by \\na government organization, such as the ministry \\nof education. Such countries with government \\naccreditations include China, France, Germany, \\nIsrael, Italy, and Russia.\\nIn other countries, however, the accredita -\\ntion process is independent of government and \\nperformed by private membership associations. \\nFor example, in the United States, engineer -\\ning accreditation is performed by an organiza -\\ntion known as ABET. An organization known as \\nCSAB serving as a participating body of ABET \\nis the lead society within ABET for the accredita-\\ntion of degree programs in software engineering.\\nWhile the process of accreditation may be dif -\\nferent for each country and jurisdiction, the general \\nmeaning is the same. For an institution’s course of \\nstudy to be accredited means that “the accredita -\\ntion body recognizes an educational institution as \\nmaintaining standards that qualify the graduates \\nfor admission to higher or more specialized insti-\\ntutions or for professional practice” [2]. \\n1.1.2. Certification\\nCertification refers to the confirmation of a per -\\nson’s particular characteristics. A common type \\nof certification is professional certification, where \\na person is certified as being able to complete an \\nactivity in a certain discipline at a stated level \\nof competency. Professional certification also \\ncan also verify the holder’s ability to meet pro -\\nfessional standards and to apply professional \\njudgment in solving or addressing problems. \\nProfessional certification can also involve the \\nverification of prescribed knowledge, the master-\\ning of best practice and proven methodologies, \\nand the amount of professional experience.\\nAn engineer usually obtains certification by \\npassing an examination in conjunction with other \\nexperience-based criteria. These examinations \\nare often administered by nongovernmental orga-\\nnizations, such as professional societies.\\nIn software engineering, certification testi -\\nfies to one’s qualification as a software engineer. \\nFor example, the IEEE CS has enacted two cer -\\ntification programs (CSDA and CSDP) designed \\nto confirm a software engineer’s knowledge of \\nstandard software engineering practices and to \\nadvance one’s career. A lack of certification does \\nnot exclude the individual from working as a \\nsoftware engineer. Currently certification in soft-\\nware engineering is completely voluntary. In fact, \\nmost software engineers are not certified under \\nany program.\\n1.1.3. Licensing\\n“Licensing” is the action of giving a person the \\nauthorization to perform certain kinds of activi -\\nties and take responsibility for resultant engineer-\\ning products. The noun “license” refers to both \\nthat authorization and the document recording \\nthat authorization. Governmental authorities or \\nstatutory bodies usually issue licenses.\\nObtaining a license to practice requires not only \\nthat an individual meets a certain standard, but \\nalso that they do so with a certain ability to prac-\\ntice or operate. Sometimes there is an entry-level \\nrequirement which sets the minimum skills and \\ncapabilities to practice, but as the professional \\nmoves through his or her career, the required \\nskills and capabilities change and evolve.\\nIn general, engineers are licensed as a means of \\nprotecting the public from unqualified individuals. \\nIn some countries, no one can practice as a pro -\\nfessional engineer unless licensed; or further, no ')),\n",

Codes\\u2008of\\u2008Ethics\\u2008and\\u2008Professional\\u2008Conduct\\u2008\\n[1*, c1s6–c1s9] [3*, c8] [4*, c1s2] [5*, c33] \\n[6*]\\nCodes of ethics and professional conduct com -\\nprise the values and behavior that an engineer’s \\nprofessional practice and decisions should \\nembody.\\nThe professional community establishes codes \\nof ethics and professional conduct. They exist \\nin the context of, and are adjusted to agree with, \\nsocietal norms and local laws. Therefore, codes \\nof ethics and professional conduct present guid -\\nance in the face of conflicting imperatives. \\nOnce established, codes of ethics and profes -\\nsional conduct are enforced by the profession, \\nas represented by professional societies or by a \\nstatutory body.\\nViolations may be acts of commission, such \\nas concealing inadequate work, disclosing con -\\nfidential information, falsifying information, or \\nmisrepresenting one’s abilities. They may also \\noccur through omission, including failure to dis -\\nclose risks or to provide important information, \\nfailure to give proper credit or to acknowledge \\nreferences, and failure to represent client inter -\\nests. Violations of codes of ethics and profes -\\nsional conduct may result in penalties and pos -\\nsible expulsion from professional status. \\nA code of ethics and professional conduct for \\nsoftware engineering was approved by the ACM \\nCouncil and the IEEE CS Board of Governors in \\n1999 [6*]. According to the short version of this \\ncode: \\nSoftware engineers shall commit them -\\nselves to making the analysis, specifica -\\ntion, design, development, testing and \\nmaintenance of software a beneficial and \\nrespected profession. In accordance with \\ntheir commitment to the health, safety and \\nwelfare of the public, software engineers \\nshall adhere to the eight principles con -\\ncerning the public, client and employer, \\nproduct, judgment, management, profes -\\nsion, colleagues, and self, respectively. \\nSince standards and codes of ethics and pro -\\nfessional conduct may be introduced, modified, \\nor replaced at any time, individual software engi-\\nneers bear the responsibility for their own con -\\ntinuing study to stay current in their professional \\npractice. \\n1.3. Nature\\u2008and\\u2008Role\\u2008of\\u2008Professional\\u2008Societies\\n[1*, c1s1–c1s2] [4*, c1s2] [5*, c35s1]\\nProfessional societies are comprised of a mix \\nof practitioners and academics. These societies \\nserve to define, advance, and regulate their cor -\\nresponding professions. Professional societies \\nhelp to establish professional standards as well \\nas codes of ethics and professional conduct. For \\nthis reason, they also engage in related activities, \\nwhich include\\n• establishing and promulgating a body of gen-\\nerally accepted knowledge;\\n• accrediting, certifying, and licensing; \\n• dispensing disciplinary actions;\\n• advancing the profession through confer -\\nences, training, and publications.\\nParticipation in professional societies assists \\nthe individual engineer in maintaining and sharp-\\nening their professional knowledge and relevancy \\nand in expanding and maintaining their profes -\\nsional network.\\n1.4.

They provide guidelines for \\nthe practice of software engineering and processes \\nto be used during development, maintenance, and \\nsupport of software. By establishing a consensual \\nbody of knowledge and experience, software engi-\\nneering standards establish a basis upon which fur-\\nther guidelines may be developed.

Economic\\u2008Impact\\u2008of\\u2008Software\\n[3*, c10s8] [4*, c1s1.1] [8*, c1]\\nSoftware has economic effects at the individual, \\nbusiness, and societal levels. Software “success” \\nmay be determined by the suitability of a product \\nfor a recognized problem as well as by its effec -\\ntiveness when applied to that problem.\\nAt the individual level, an engineer’s continu -\\ning employment may depend on their ability \\nand willingness to interpret and execute tasks \\nin meeting customers’ or employers’ needs and \\nexpectations. The customer or employer’s finan -\\ncial situation may in turn be positively or nega -\\ntively affected by the purchase of software.\\nAt the business level, software properly applied \\nto a problem can eliminate months of work \\nand translate to elevated profits or more effec -\\ntive organizations. Moreover, organizations that \\nacquire or provide successful software may be a \\nboon to the society in which they operate by pro-\\nviding both employment and improved services. \\nHowever, the development or acquisition costs of \\nsoftware can also equate to those of any major \\nacquisition.\\nAt the societal level, direct impacts of software \\nsuccess or failure include or exclude accidents, \\ninterruptions, and loss of service. Indirect impacts \\ninclude the success or failure of the organization \\nthat acquired or produced the software, increased \\nor decreased societal productivity, harmonious \\nor disruptive social order, and even the saving or \\nloss of property and life.\\n1.6. Employment\\u2008Contracts\\n[1*, c7]\\nSoftware engineering services may be provided \\nunder a variety of client-engineer relationships. \\nThe software engineering work may be solic -\\nited as company-to-customer supplier, engineer-\\nto-customer consultancy, direct hire, or even \\nvolunteering. In all of these situations, the cus -\\ntomer and supplier agree that a product or ser -\\nvice will be provided in return for some sort of \\nconsideration. Here, we are most concerned with \\nthe engineer-to-customer arrangement and its \\nattendant agreements or contracts, whether they \\nare of the direct-hire or consultant variety, and \\nthe issues they typically address.\\nA common concern in software engineering \\ncontracts is confidentiality. Employers derive \\ncommercial advantage from intellectual property, \\nso they strive to protect that property from dis -\\nclosure. Therefore, software engineers are often \\nrequired to sign non-disclosure (NDA) or intel -\\nlectual property (IP) agreements as a precondi -\\ntion to work. These agreements typically apply \\nto information the software engineer could only \\ngain through association with the customer. The \\nterms of these agreements may extend past termi-\\nnation of the association.\\nAnother concern is IP ownership. Rights to \\nsoftware engineering assets—products, innova -\\ntions, inventions, discoveries, and ideas—may \\nreside with the employer or customer, either under \\nexplicit contract terms or relevant laws, if those \\nassets are obtained during the term of the soft -\\nware engineer’s relationship with that employer \\nor customer. Contracts differ in the ownership of \\nassets created using non-employer-owned equip-\\nment or information.\\nFinally, contracts can also specify among \\nother elements the location at which work is to \\nbe performed; standards to which that work will \\nbe held; the system configuration to be used for \\ndevelopment; limitations of the software engi -\\nneer’s and employer’s liability; a communication \\nmatrix and/or escalation plan; and administrative \\ndetails such as rates, frequency of compensation, \\nworking hours, and working conditions.\\n1.7.\\u2008Legal\\u2008Issues\\u2008\\n[1*, c6, c11] [3*, c5s3–c5s4] [9*, c1s10]\\nLegal issues surrounding software engineering \\nprofessional practice notably include matters \\nrelated to standards, trademarks, patents, copy -\\nrights, trade secrets, professional liability, legal \\nrequirements, trade compliance, and cybercrime. \\nIt is therefore beneficial to possess knowledge of \\nthese issues and their applicability.\\nLegal issues are jurisdictionally based; soft -\\nware engineers must consult attorneys who ')),\n",

Appendix B of this \\nGuide provides guidance on software engineer -\\ning standards that are applicable to each KA.\\nStandards are valuable sources of requirements \\nand assistance during the everyday conduct of \\nsoftware engineering activities. Adherence to \\nstandards facilitates discipline by enumerating \\nminimal characteristics of products and practice. \\nThat discipline helps to mitigate subconscious \\nassumptions or overconfidence in a design. For \\nthese reasons, organizations performing software \\nengineering activities often include conformance \\nto standards as part of their organizational poli -\\ncies. Further, adherence to standards is a major \\ncomponent of defense from legal action or from \\nallegations of malpractice. \\n1.7.2.\\u2008Trademarks\\nA trademark relates to any word, name, symbol, \\nor device that is used in business transactions. \\nIt is used “to indicate the source or origin of the \\ngoods” [2].\\nTrademark protection protects names, logos, \\nimages, and packaging. However, if a name, image, \\nor other trademarked asset becomes a generic term, \\nthen trademark protection is nullified.\\nThe World Intellectual Property Organization \\n(WIPO) is the authority that frames the rules and \\nregulations on trademarks. WIPO is the United \\nNations agency dedicated to the use of intellec -\\ntual property as a means of stimulating innova -\\ntion and creativity. \\n1.7.3.\\u2008Patents\\nPatents protect an inventor’s right to manufac -\\nture and sell an idea. A patent consists of a set \\nof exclusive rights granted by a sovereign gov -\\nernment to an individual, group of individuals, or \\norganization for a limited period of time. Patents \\nare an old form of idea-ownership protection and \\ndate back to the 15th century.\\nApplication for a patent entails careful records \\nof the process that led to the invention. Patent \\nattorneys are helpful in writing patent disclosure \\nclaims in a manner most likely to protect the soft-\\nware engineer’s rights. \\nNote that, if inventions are made during the \\ncourse of a software engineering contract, owner-\\nship may belong to the employer or customer or \\nbe jointly held, rather than belong to the software \\nengineer.\\nThere are rules concerning what is and is not \\npatentable. In many countries, software code is \\nnot patentable, although software algorithms may \\nbe. Existing and filed patent applications can be \\nsearched at WIPO. \\n1.7.4.\\u2008Copyrights\\nMost governments in the world give exclusive \\nrights of an original work to its creator, usually \\nfor a limited time, enacted as a copyright. Copy -\\nrights protect the way an idea is presented—not \\nthe idea itself. For example, they may protect the \\nparticular wording of an account of an historical \\nevent, whereas the event itself is not protected. \\nCopyrights are long-term and renewable; they \\ndate back to the 17th century.\\n1.7.5.\\u2008Trade\\u2008Secrets\\nIn many countries, an intellectual asset such as \\na formula, algorithm, process, design, method, \\npattern, instrument, or compilation of informa -\\ntion may be considered a “trade secret,” provided \\nthat these assets are not generally known and may \\nprovide a business some economic advantage. \\nThe designation of “trade secret” provides legal \\nprotection if the asset is stolen. This protection \\nis not subject to a time limit. However, if another \\nparty derives or discovers the same asset legally, \\nthen the asset is no longer protected and the other \\nparty will also possess all rights to use it.\\n1.7.6.\\u2008Professional\\u2008Liability\\nIt is common for software engineers to be con -\\ncerned with matters of professional liability. As ')),\n",

Under the laws and rules governing in their \\njurisdiction, engineers may be held to account \\nfor failing to fully and conscientiously follow \\nrecommended practice; this is known as “negli -\\ngence.” They may also be subject to laws govern-\\ning “strict liability” and either implied or express \\nwarranty, where, by selling the product, the engi-\\nneer is held to warrant that the product is both \\nsuitable and safe for use. In some countries (for \\nexample, in the US), “privity” (the idea that one \\ncould only sue the person selling the product) is \\nno longer a defense against liability actions.\\nLegal suits for liability can be brought under \\ntort law in the US allowing anyone who is harmed \\nto recover their loss even if no guarantees were \\nmade. Because it is difficult to measure the suit -\\nability or safety of software, failure to take due \\ncare can be used to prove negligence on the part \\nof software engineers. A defense against such an \\nallegation is to show that standards and generally \\naccepted practices were followed in the develop-\\nment of the product.\\n1.7.7.\\u2008Legal\\u2008Requirements\\nSoftware engineers must operate within the con -\\nfines of local, national, and international legal \\nframeworks. Therefore, software engineers must \\nbe aware of legal requirements for\\n• registration and licensing—including exami-\\nnation, education, experience, and training \\nrequirements;\\n• contractual agreements; \\n• noncontractual legalities, such as those gov -\\nerning liability;\\n• Basic information on the international legal \\nframework can be accessed from the World \\nTrade Organization (WTO). \\n1.7.8.\\u2008Trade\\u2008Compliance\\nAll software professionals must be aware of \\nlegal restrictions on import, export, or reexport \\nof goods, services, and technology in the juris -\\ndictions in which they work. The considerations \\ninclude export controls and classification, transfer \\nof goods, acquisition of necessary governmental \\nlicenses for foreign use of hardware and software, \\nservices and technology by sanctioned nation, \\nenterprise or individual entities, and import \\nrestrictions and duties. Trade experts should be \\nconsulted for detailed compliance guidance.\\n1.7.9.\\u2008Cybercrime\\nCybercrime refers to any crime that involves \\na computer, computer software, computer net -\\nworks, or embedded software controlling a sys -\\ntem. The computer or software may have been \\nused in the commission of a crime or it may have \\nbeen the target.

In particular, software \\nengineers should document\\n• relevant facts, \\n• significant risks and tradeoffs, and \\n• warnings of undesirable or dangerous conse-\\nquences from use or misuse of the software.\\nSoftware engineers should avoid\\n• certifying or approving unacceptable products,\\n• disclosing confidential information, or\\n• falsifying facts or data.\\nIn addition, software engineers and their man -\\nagers should notably provide the following docu-\\nmentation for use by other elements of the soft -\\nware development organization:\\n• software requirements specifications, soft -\\nware design documents, details on the soft -\\nware engineering tools used, software test \\nspecifications and results, and details on the \\nadopted software engineering methods;\\n• problems encountered during the develop -\\nment process.\\nFor external stakeholders (customer, users, \\nothers) software documentation should notably \\nprovide\\n• information needed to determine if the soft -\\nware is likely to meet the customer’s and \\nusers’ needs,\\n• description of the safe, and unsafe, use of the \\nsoftware, \\n• description of the protection of sensitive \\ninformation created by or stored using the \\nsoftware, and\\n• clear identification of warnings and critical \\nprocedures. \\nUse of software may include installation, oper-\\nation, administration, and performance of other \\nfunctions by various groups of users and support \\npersonnel. If the customer will acquire ownership \\nof the software source code or the right to modify \\nthe code, the software engineer should provide \\ndocumentation of the functional specifications, \\nthe software design, the test suite, and the neces -\\nsary operating environment for the software.\\nThe minimum length of time documents should \\nbe kept is the duration of the software products’ \\nlife cycle or the time required by relevant organi-\\nzational or regulatory requirements.\\n1.9.\\u2008Tradeoff\\u2008Analysis\\u2008\\n[3*, c1s2, c10] [9*, c9s5.10]\\nWithin the practice of software engineering, a \\nsoftware engineer often has to choose between \\nalternative problem solutions. The outcome of \\nthese choices is determined by the software engi-\\nneer’s professional evaluation of the risks, costs, \\nand benefits of alternatives, in cooperation with \\nstakeholders. The software engineer’s evaluation \\nis called “tradeoff analysis.” Tradeoff analysis \\nnotably enables the identification of compet -\\ning and complementary software requirements \\nin order to prioritize the final set of require -\\nments defining the software to be constructed \\n(see Requirements Negotiation in the Software \\nRequirements KA and Determination and Nego -\\ntiation of Requirements in the Software Engi -\\nneering Management KA). \\nIn the case of an ongoing software develop -\\nment project that is late or over budget, tradeoff \\nanalysis is often conducted to decide which soft -\\nware requirements can be relaxed or dropped \\ngiven the effects thereof.\\nA first step in a tradeoff analysis is establish -\\ning design goals (see Engineering Design in the \\nEngineering Foundations KA) and setting the \\nrelative importance of those goals. This permits \\nidentification of the solution that most nearly \\nmeets those goals; this means that the way the \\ngoals are stated is critically important. \\nDesign goals may include minimization of \\nmonetary cost and maximization of reliability, \\nperformance, or some other criteria on a wide \\nrange of dimensions. However, it is difficult to \\nformulate a tradeoff analysis of cost against risk, \\nespecially where primary production and second-\\nary risk-based costs must be traded against each \\nother.

Any conflict of interest must be disclosed \\nup front.\\n2. Group Dynamics and Psychology\\nEngineering work is very often conducted in the \\ncontext of teamwork. A software engineer must \\nbe able to interact cooperatively and construc -\\ntively with others to first determine and then \\nmeet both needs and expectations. Knowledge of \\ngroup dynamics and psychology is an asset when \\ninteracting with customers, coworkers, suppliers, \\nand subordinates to solve software engineering \\nproblems. \\n2.1. Dynamics\\u2008of\\u2008Working\\u2008in\\u2008Teams/Groups\\u2008\\n[3*, c1s6] [9*, c1s3.5, c10]\\nSoftware engineers must work with others. On \\none hand, they work internally in engineering \\nteams; on the other hand, they work with cus -\\ntomers, members of the public, regulators, and \\nother stakeholders. Performing teams—those \\nthat demonstrate consistent quality of work and \\nprogress toward goals—are cohesive and possess \\na cooperative, honest, and focused atmosphere. \\nIndividual and team goals are aligned so that the \\nmembers naturally commit to and feel ownership \\nof shared outcomes. \\nTeam members facilitate this atmosphere by \\nbeing intellectually honest, making use of group \\nthinking, admitting ignorance, and acknowledg -\\ning mistakes. They share responsibility, rewards, \\nand workload fairly. They take care to communi-\\ncate clearly, directly to each other and in docu -\\nments, as well as in source code, so that informa-\\ntion is accessible to everyone. Peer reviews about \\nwork products are framed in a constructive and \\nnonpersonal way (see Reviews and Audits in the \\nSoftware Quality KA). This allows all the mem -\\nbers to pursue a cycle of continuous improvement \\nand growth without personal risk. In general, \\nmembers of cohesive teams demonstrate respect \\nfor each other and their leader. \\nOne point to emphasize is that software engi -\\nneers must be able to work in multidisciplinary \\nenvironments and in varied application domains. \\nSince today software is everywhere, from a phone \\nto a car, software is impacting people’s lives far \\nbeyond the more traditional concept of software \\nmade for information management in a business \\nenvironment. \\n2.2. Individual\\u2008Cognition\\n[3*, c1s6.5] [5*, c33]\\nEngineers desire to solve problems. The ability to \\nsolve problems effectively and efficiently is what \\nevery engineer strives for. However, the limits \\nand processes of individual cognition affect prob-\\nlem solving. In software engineering, notably due \\nto the highly abstract nature of software itself, \\nindividual cognition plays a very prominent role \\nin problem solving.\\nIn general, an individual’s (in particular, a software \\nengineer’s) ability to decompose a problem and cre-\\natively develop a solution can be inhibited by\\n• need for more knowledge,\\n• subconscious assumptions,\\n• volume of data,\\n• fear of failure or consequence of failure, \\n• culture, either application domain or \\norganizational,\\n• lack of ability to express the problem,\\n• perceived working atmosphere, and\\n• emotional status of the individual.\\nThe impact of these inhibiting factors can be \\nreduced by cultivating good problem solving \\nhabits that minimize the impact of misleading \\nassumptions. The ability to focus is vital, as is \\nintellectual humility: both allow a software engi-\\nneer to suspend personal considerations and con-\\nsult with others freely, which is especially impor-\\ntant when working in teams.\\nThere is a set of basic methods engineers use \\nto facilitate problem solving (see Problem Solv -\\ning Techniques in the Computing Foundations \\nKA). Breaking down problems and solving them \\none piece at a time reduces cognitive overload. \\nTaking advantage of professional curiosity and \\npursuing continuous professional development ')),\n",

Dealing\\u2008with\\u2008Problem\\u2008Complexity\\u2008\\n[3*, c3s2] [5*, c33]\\nMany, if not most, software engineering prob -\\nlems are too complex and difficult to address as \\na whole or to be tackled by individual software \\nengineers. When such circumstances arise, the \\nusual means to adopt is teamwork and problem \\ndecomposition (see Problem Solving Techniques \\nin the Computing Foundations KA). \\nTeams work together to deal with complex and \\nlarge problems by sharing burdens and draw -\\ning upon each other’s knowledge and creativity. \\nWhen software engineers work in teams, differ -\\nent views and abilities of the individual engineers \\ncomplement each other and help build a solution \\nthat is otherwise difficult to come by. Some spe -\\ncific teamwork examples to software engineering \\nare pair programming (see Agile Methods in the \\nSoftware Engineering Models and Methods KA) \\nand code review (see Reviews and Audits in the \\nSoftware Quality KA).\\n2.4. Interacting\\u2008with\\u2008Stakeholders\\n[9*, c2s3.1]\\nSuccess of a software engineering endeavor \\ndepends upon positive interactions with stake -\\nholders. They should provide support, informa -\\ntion, and feedback at all stages of the software \\nlife cycle process. For example, during the early \\nstages, it is critical to identify all stakeholders and \\ndiscover how the product will affect them, so that \\nsufficient definition of the stakeholder require -\\nments can be properly and completely captured. \\nDuring development, stakeholders may pro -\\nvide feedback on specifications and/or early \\nversions of the software, change of priority, as \\nwell as clarification of detailed or new software \\nrequirements. Last, during software maintenance \\nand until the end of product life, stakeholders pro-\\nvide feedback on evolving or new requirements \\nas well problem reports so that the software may \\nbe extended and improved. \\nTherefore, it is vital to maintain open and pro -\\nductive communication with stakeholders for the \\nduration of the software product’s lifetime. \\n2.5. Dealing\\u2008with\\u2008Uncertainty\\u2008and\\u2008Ambiguity\\u2008\\n[4*, c24s4, c26s2] [9*, c9s4]\\nAs with engineers of other fields, software engi -\\nneers must often deal with and resolve uncer -\\ntainty and ambiguities while providing services \\nand developing products. The software engineer \\nmust attack and reduce or eliminate any lack of \\nclarity that is an obstacle to performing work.\\nOften, uncertainty is simply a reflection of lack \\nof knowledge. In this case, investigation through \\nrecourse to formal sources such as textbooks and \\nprofessional journals, interviews with stakehold -\\ners, or consultation with teammates and peers can \\novercome it.\\nWhen uncertainty or ambiguity cannot be over-\\ncome easily, software engineers or organizations \\nmay choose to regard it as a project risk. In this \\ncase, work estimates or pricing are adjusted to \\nmitigate the anticipated cost of addressing it (see \\nRisk Management in the Software Engineering \\nManagement KA).\\n2.6. Dealing\\u2008with\\u2008Multicultural\\u2008Environments\\u2008\\n[9*, c10s7]\\nMulticultural environments can have an impact \\non the dynamics of a group. This is especially \\ntrue when the group is geographically separated \\nor communication is infrequent, since such sepa-\\nration elevates the importance of each contact. \\nIntercultural communication is even more dif -\\nficult if the difference in time zones make oral \\ncommunication less frequent. \\nMulticultural environments are quite prevalent \\nin software engineering, perhaps more than in \\nother fields of engineering, due to the strong trend \\nof international outsourcing and the easy shipment \\nof software components instantaneously across \\nthe globe. For example, it is rather common for a \\nsoftware project to be divided into pieces across \\nnational and cultural borders, and it is also quite \\ncommon for a software project team to consist of \\npeople from diverse cultural backgrounds. \\nFor a software project to be a success, team \\nmembers must achieve a level of tolerance, ')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 200}, page_content='Software Engineering Professional Practice 11-11\\nacknowledging that some rules depend on soci -\\netal norms and that not all societies derive the \\nsame solutions and expectations. \\nThis tolerance and accompanying understand -\\ning can be facilitated by the support of leadership \\nand management. More frequent communication, \\nincluding face-to-face meetings, can help to miti-\\ngate geographical and cultural divisions, promote \\ncohesiveness, and raise productivity. Also, being \\nable to communicate with teammates in their \\nnative language could be very beneficial.\\n3. Communication Skills \\nIt is vital that a software engineer communicate \\nwell, both orally and in reading and writing. Suc-\\ncessful attainment of software requirements and \\ndeadlines depends on developing clear under -\\nstanding between the software engineer and \\ncustomers, supervisors, coworkers, and suppli -\\ners. Optimal problem solving is made possible \\nthrough the ability to investigate, comprehend, \\nand summarize information. Customer product \\nacceptance and safe product usage depend on the \\nprovision of relevant training and documentation. \\nIt follows that the software engineer’s own career \\nsuccess is affected by the ability to consistently \\nprovide oral and written communication effec -\\ntively and on time. \\n3.1. Reading,\\u2008Understanding,\\u2008and\\u2008Summarizing\\u2008\\n[5*, c33s3]\\nSoftware engineers are able to read and under -\\nstand technical material. Technical material \\nincludes reference books, manuals, research \\npapers, and program source code.\\nReading is not only a primary way of improv -\\ning skills, but also a way of gathering informa -\\ntion necessary for the completion of engineering \\ngoals. A software engineer sifts through accu -\\nmulated information, filtering out the pieces that \\nwill be most helpful. Customers may request that \\na software engineer summarize the results of \\nsuch information gathering for them, simplifying \\nor explaining it so that they may make the final \\nchoice between competing solutions.\\nReading and comprehending source code is \\nalso a component of information gathering and \\nproblem solving. When modifying, extending, \\nor rewriting software, it is critical to understand \\nboth its implementation directly derived from the \\npresented code and its design, which must often \\nbe inferred. \\n3.2. Writing\\u2008\\n[3*, c1s5]\\nSoftware engineers are able to produce written \\nproducts as required by customer requests or gen-\\nerally accepted practice. These written products \\nmay include source code, software project plans, \\nsoftware requirement documents, risk analyses, \\nsoftware design documents, software test plans, \\nuser manuals, technical reports and evaluations, \\njustifications, diagrams and charts, and so forth. \\nWriting clearly and concisely is very important \\nbecause often it is the primary method of com -\\nmunication among relevant parties. In all cases, \\nwritten software engineering products must be \\nwritten so that they are accessible, understand -\\nable and relevant for their intended audience(s).\\n3.3. Team\\u2008and\\u2008Group\\u2008Communication\\u2008\\n[3*, c1s6.8] [4*, c22s3] [5*, c27s1]\\n [9*, c10s4]\\nEffective communication among team and group \\nmembers is essential to a collaborative software \\nengineering effort. Stakeholders must be con -\\nsulted, decisions must be made, and plans must \\nbe generated. The greater the number of team \\nand group members, the greater the need to \\ncommunicate.\\nThe number of communication paths, how -\\never, grows quadratically with the addition of \\neach team member. Further, team members \\nare unlikely to communicate with anyone per -\\nceived to be removed from them by more than \\ntwo degrees (levels). This problem can be more \\nserious when software engineering endeavors or \\norganizations are spread across national and con-\\ntinental borders. \\nSome communication can be accomplished in \\nwriting. Software documentation is a common \\nsubstitute for direct interaction.

In addi -\\ntion, the use of electronic information stores, \\naccessible to all team members, for organiza -\\ntional policies, standards, common engineering \\nprocedures, and project-specific information, can \\nbe most beneficial. \\nSome software engineering teams focus on \\nface-to-face interaction and promote such inter -\\naction by office space arrangement. Although \\nprivate offices improve individual productivity, \\ncolocating team members in physical or virtual \\nforms and providing communal work areas is \\nimportant to collaborative efforts. \\n3.4. Presentation\\u2008Skills\\u2008\\n[3*, c1s5] [4*, c22] [9*, c10s7–c10s8]\\nSoftware engineers rely on their presentation \\nskills during software life cycle processes. For \\nexample, during the software requirements \\nphase, software engineers may walk customers \\nand teammates through software requirements \\nand conduct formal requirements reviews (see \\nRequirement Reviews in the Software Require -\\nments KA). During and after software design, \\nsoftware construction, and software maintenance, \\nsoftware engineers lead reviews, product walk -\\nthroughs (see Review and Audits in the Software \\nQuality KA), and training. All of these require the \\nability to present technical information to groups \\nand solicit ideas or feedback. \\nThe software engineer’s ability to convey \\nconcepts effectively in a presentation therefore \\ninfluences product acceptance, management, \\nand customer support; it also influences the abil -\\nity of stakeholders to comprehend and assist in \\nthe product effort. This knowledge needs to be \\narchived in the form of slides, knowledge write-\\nup, technical whitepapers, and any other material \\nutilized for knowledge creation.')),\n",

The success of a software prod-\\nuct, service, and solution depends on good busi -\\nness management. Yet, in many companies and \\norganizations, software business relationships to \\nsoftware development and engineering remain \\nvague. This knowledge area (KA) provides an \\noverview on software engineering economics. \\nEconomics is the study of value, costs, \\nresources, and their relationship in a given context \\nor situation. In the discipline of software engi -\\nneering, activities have costs, but the resulting \\nsoftware itself has economic attributes as well. \\nSoftware engineering economics provides a way \\nto study the attributes of software and software \\nprocesses in a systematic way that relates them \\nto economic measures. These economic measures \\ncan be weighed and analyzed when making deci-\\nsions that are within the scope of a software orga-\\nnization and those within the integrated scope of \\nan entire producing or acquiring business.\\nSoftware engineering economics is concerned \\nwith aligning software technical decisions with \\nthe business goals of the organization. In all \\ntypes of organizations—be it “for-profit,” “not-\\nfor-profit,” or governmental—this translates into \\nsustainably staying in business. In “for-profit” \\norganizations this additionally relates to achiev -\\ning a tangible return on the invested capital—\\nboth assets and capital employed. This KA has \\nbeen formulated in a way to address all types of \\norganizations independent of focus, product and \\nservice portfolio, or capital ownership and taxa -\\ntion restrictions.\\nDecisions like “Should we use a specific compo-\\nnent?” may look easy from a technical perspective, \\nbut can have serious implications on the business \\nviability of a software project and the resulting \\nproduct. Often engineers wonder whether such \\nconcerns apply at all, as they are “only engi -\\nneers.” Economic analysis and decision-making \\nare important engineering considerations because \\nengineers are capable of evaluating decisions both \\ntechnically and from a business perspective. The \\ncontents of this knowledge area are important top-\\nics for software engineers to be aware of even if \\nthey are never actually involved in concrete busi-\\nness decisions; they will have a well-rounded view \\nof business issues and the role technical consid -\\nerations play in making business decisions. Many \\nengineering proposals and decisions, such as make \\nversus buy, have deep intrinsic economic impacts \\nthat should be considered explicitly.\\nThis KA first covers the foundations, key ter -\\nminology, basic concepts, and common practices \\nof software engineering economics to indicate \\nhow decision-making in software engineering \\nincludes, or should include a business perspec -\\ntive. It then provides a life cycle perspective, \\nhighlights risk and uncertainty management, and \\nshows how economic analysis methods are used. \\nSome practical considerations finalize the knowl-\\nedge area.')),\n",

Software Engineering Economics \\nFundamentals\\n1.1. Finance\\n[1*, c2] \\nFinance is the branch of economics concerned \\nwith issues such as allocation, management, \\nacquisition, and investment of resources. Finance \\nis an element of every organization, including \\nsoftware engineering organizations.\\nThe field of finance deals with the concepts of \\ntime, money, risk, and how they are interrelated. \\nIt also deals with how money is spent and bud -\\ngeted. Corporate finance is concerned with pro -\\nviding the funds for an organization’s activities. \\nGenerally, this involves balancing risk and profit-\\nability, while attempting to maximize an organi -\\nzation’s wealth and the value of its stock. This \\nholds primarily for “for-profit” organizations, \\nbut also applies to “not-for-profit” organizations. \\nThe latter needs finances to ensure sustainability, \\nwhile not targeting tangible profit. To do this, an \\norganization must\\n• identify organizational goals, time horizons, \\nrisk factors, tax considerations, and financial \\nconstraints;\\n• identify and implement the appropriate busi-\\nness strategy, such as which portfolio and \\ninvestment decisions to take, how to manage \\ncash flow, and where to get the funding;\\n• measure financial performance, such as \\ncash flow and ROI (see section 4.3, Return \\non Investment), and take corrective actions \\nin case of deviation from objectives and \\nstrategy.\\n1.2. Accounting\\n[1*, c15]\\nAccounting is part of finance. It allows people \\nwhose money is being used to run an organization \\nto know the results of their investment: did they \\nget the profit they were expecting? In “for-profit” \\norganizations, this relates to the tangible ROI \\n(see section 4.3, Return on Investment), while in \\n“not-for-profit” and governmental organizations \\nas well as “for-profit” organizations, it translates \\ninto sustainably staying in business. The primary \\nrole of accounting is to measure the organiza -\\ntion’s actual financial performance and to com -\\nmunicate financial information about a business \\nentity to stakeholders, such as shareholders, \\nfinancial auditors, and investors. Communication \\nis generally in the form of financial statements \\nthat show in money terms the economic resources \\nto be controlled. It is important to select the right \\ninformation that is both relevant and reliable to \\nthe user. Information and its timing are partially \\ngoverned by risk management and governance \\npolicies. Accounting systems are also a rich \\nsource of historical data for estimating.\\n1.3. Controlling\\n[1*, c15]\\nControlling is an element of finance and account-\\ning. Controlling involves measuring and correct -\\ning the performance of finance and accounting. \\nIt ensures that an organization’s objectives and \\nplans are accomplished. Controlling cost is a spe-\\ncialized branch of controlling used to detect vari-\\nances of actual costs from planned costs.\\n1.4. Cash\\u2008Flow\\n[1*, c3]\\nCash flow is the movement of money into or out \\nof a business, project, or financial product over a \\ngiven period. The concepts of cash flow instances \\nand cash flow streams are used to describe the \\nbusiness perspective of a proposal. To make a \\nmeaningful business decision about any specific \\nproposal, that proposal will need to be evaluated \\nfrom a business perspective. In a proposal to \\ndevelop and launch product X, the payment for \\nnew software licenses is an example of an outgo-\\ning cash flow instance. Money would need to be \\nspent to carry out that proposal. The sales income \\nfrom product X in the 11th month after market \\nlaunch is an example of an incoming cash flow ')),\n",

Money would be coming in because of \\ncarrying out the proposal. \\nThe term cash\\u2008flow\\u2008stream refers to the set of \\ncash flow instances over time that are caused by \\ncarrying out some given proposal. The cash flow \\nstream is, in effect, the complete financial picture \\nof that proposal. How much money goes out? \\nWhen does it go out? How much money comes \\nin? When does it come in? Simply, if the cash \\nflow stream for Proposal A is more desirable than \\nthe cash flow stream for Proposal B, then—all \\nother things being equal—the organization is bet-\\nter off carrying out Proposal A than Proposal B. \\nThus, the cash flow stream is an important input \\nfor investment decision-making. A cash flow \\ninstance is a specific amount of money flowing \\ninto or out of the organization at a specific time \\nas a direct result of some activity.\\nA cash flow diagram is a picture of a cash flow \\nstream. It gives the reader a quick overview of \\nthe financial picture of the subject organization or \\nproject. Figure 12.2 shows an example of a cash \\nflow diagram for a proposal.\\n1.5. Decision-Making\\u2008Process\\n[1*, c2, c4]\\nIf we assume that candidate solutions solve a \\ngiven technical problem equally well, why should \\nthe organization care which one is chosen? The \\nanswer is that there is usually a large differ -\\nence in the costs and incomes from the different \\nsolutions. A commercial, off-the-shelf, object-\\nrequest broker product might cost a few thousand \\ndollars, but the effort to develop a homegrown \\nservice that gives the same functionality could \\neasily cost several hundred times that amount. \\nIf the candidate solutions all adequately solve \\nthe problem from a technical perspective, then \\nthe selection of the most appropriate alternative \\nshould be based on commercial factors such as \\noptimizing total cost of ownership (TCO) or \\nmaximizing the short-term return on investment \\n(ROI). Life cycle costs such as defect correction, \\nfield service, and support duration are also rel -\\nevant considerations. These costs need to be fac -\\ntored in when selecting among acceptable tech -\\nnical approaches, as they are part of the lifetime \\nROI (see section 4.3, Return on Investment). \\nA systematic process for making decisions will \\nachieve transparency and allow later justifica -\\ntion. Governance criteria in many organizations \\ndemand selection from at least two alternatives. \\nA systematic process is shown in Figure 12.3. \\nIt starts with a business challenge at hand and \\ndescribes the steps to identify alternative solu -\\ntions, define selection criteria, evaluate the solu -\\ntions, implement one selected solution, and moni-\\ntor the performance of that solution.\\nFigure 12.3 shows the process as mostly step -\\nwise and serial. The real process is more fluid. \\nSometimes the steps can be done in a different \\norder and often several of the steps can be done \\nin parallel. The important thing is to be sure that \\nFigure 12.2. A Cash Flow Diagram')),\n",

It’s also \\nimportant to understand that this same process \\napplies at all levels of decision making: from a \\ndecision as big as determining whether a software \\nproject should be done at all, to a deciding on an \\nalgorithm or data structure to use in a software \\nmodule. The difference is how financially sig -\\nnificant the decision is and, therefore, how much \\neffort should be invested in making that deci -\\nsion. The project-level decision is financially sig-\\nnificant and probably warrants a relatively high \\nlevel of effort to make the decision. Selecting an \\nalgorithm is often much less financially signifi -\\ncant and warrants a much lower level of effort to \\nmake the decision, even though the same basic \\ndecision-making process is being used.\\nMore often than not, an organization could \\ncarry out more than one proposal if it wanted \\nto, and usually there are important relationships \\namong proposals. Maybe Proposal Y can only be \\ncarried out if Proposal X is also carried out. Or \\nmaybe Proposal P cannot be carried out if Pro -\\nposal Q is carried out, nor could Q be carried out \\nif P were. Choices are much easier to make when \\nthere are mutually exclusive paths—for example, \\neither A or B or C or whatever is chosen. In pre -\\nparing decisions, it is recommended to turn any \\ngiven set of proposals, along with their various \\ninterrelationships, into a set of mutually exclu -\\nsive alternatives. The choice can then be made \\namong these alternatives.\\n1.6. Valuation\\n[1*, c5, c8]\\nIn an abstract sense, the decision-making pro -\\ncess—be it financial decision making or other—\\nis about maximizing value. The alternative that \\nmaximizes total value should always be chosen. \\nA financial basis for value-based comparison is \\ncomparing two or more cash flows. Several bases \\nof comparison are available, including\\n• present worth\\n• future worth\\n• annual equivalent\\n• internal rate of return\\n• (discounted) payback period.\\nBased on the time-value of money, two or more \\ncash flows are equivalent only when they equal \\nthe same amount of money at a common point \\nin time. Comparing cash flows only makes sense \\nwhen they are expressed in the same time frame.\\nNote that value can’t always be expressed in \\nterms of money. For example, whether an item \\nis a brand name or not can significantly affect \\nits perceived value. Relevant values that can’t \\nbe expressed in terms of money still need to be \\nexpressed in similar terms so that they can be \\nevaluated objectively.\\nFigure 12.3.

If the planning horizon of \\na business decision is longer than a few years, or \\nif the inflation rate is over a couple of percentage \\npoints annually, it can cause noticeable changes \\nin the value of a proposal. The present time value \\ntherefore needs to be adjusted for inflation rates \\nand also for exchange rate fluctuations.\\n1.8.\\u2008Depreciation\\n[1*, c14]\\nDepreciation involves spreading the cost of a \\ntangible asset across a number of time periods; \\nit is used to determine how investments in capi -\\ntalized assets are charged against income over \\nseveral years. Depreciation is an important part \\nof determining after-tax cash flow, which is criti-\\ncal for accurately addressing profit and taxes. If \\na software product is to be sold after the devel -\\nopment costs are incurred, those costs should be \\ncapitalized and depreciated over subsequent time \\nperiods. The depreciation expense for each time \\nperiod is the capitalized cost of developing the \\nsoftware divided across the number of periods \\nin which the software will be sold. A software \\nproject proposal may be compared to other soft -\\nware and nonsoftware proposals or to alternative \\ninvestment options, so it is important to deter -\\nmine how those other proposals would be depre -\\nciated and how profits would be estimated.\\n1.9.\\u2008Taxation\\n[1*, c16, c17]\\nGovernments charge taxes in order to finance \\nexpenses that society needs but that no single orga-\\nnization would invest in. Companies have to pay \\nincome taxes, which can take a substantial portion \\nof a corporation’s gross profit. A decision analysis \\nthat does not account for taxation can lead to the \\nwrong choice. A proposal with a high pretax profit \\nwon’t look nearly as profitable in posttax terms. \\nNot accounting for taxation can also lead to unre-\\nalistically high expectations about how profitable a \\nproposed product might be. \\n1.10.\\u2008Time-Value\\u2008of\\u2008Money\\n[1*, c5, c11]\\nOne of the most fundamental concepts in \\nfinance—and therefore, in business decisions—\\nis that money has time-value: its value changes \\nover time. A specific amount of money right now \\nalmost always has a different value than the same \\namount of money at some other time. This con -\\ncept has been around since the earliest recorded \\nhuman history and is commonly known as time-\\nvalue. In order to compare proposals or portfo -\\nlio elements, they should be normalized in cost, \\nvalue, and risk to the net present value. Currency \\nexchange variations over time need to be taken \\ninto account based on historical data. This is par-\\nticularly important in cross-border developments \\nof all kinds.\\n1.11. Efficiency\\n[2*, c1]\\nEconomic efficiency of a process, activity, or \\ntask is the ratio of resources actually consumed to \\nresources expected to be consumed or desired to \\nbe consumed in accomplishing the process, activ-\\nity, or task. Efficiency means “doing things right.” \\nAn efficient behavior, like an effective behavior, \\ndelivers results—but keeps the necessary effort to \\na minimum. Factors that may affect efficiency in \\nsoftware engineering include product complex -\\nity, quality requirements, time pressure, process \\ncapability, team distribution, interrupts, feature \\nchurn, tools, and programming language. \\n1.12. Effectiveness\\n[2*, c1]\\nEffectiveness is about having impact. It is the \\nrelationship between achieved objectives to \\ndefined objectives. Effectiveness means “doing \\nthe right things.” Effectiveness looks only at \\nwhether defined objectives are reached—not at \\nhow they are reached.\\n1.13. Productivity\\n[2*, c23]\\nProductivity is the ratio of output over input from \\nan economic perspective. Output is the value ')),\n",

Input covers all resources (e.g., effort) \\nspent to generate the output. Productivity com -\\nbines efficiency and effectiveness from a value-\\noriented perspective: maximizing productivity \\nis about generating highest value with lowest \\nresource consumption.\\n2. Life Cycle Economics\\n2.1. Product\\n[2*, c22] [3*, c6]\\nA product is an economic good (or output) that is \\ncreated in a process that transforms product fac -\\ntors (or inputs) to an output. When sold, a prod -\\nuct is a deliverable that creates both a value and \\nan experience for its users. A product can be a \\ncombination of systems, solutions, materials, \\nand services delivered internally (e.g., in-house \\nIT solution) or externally (e.g., software applica -\\ntion), either as-is or as a component for another \\nproduct (e.g., embedded software). \\n2.2. Project\\n[2*, c22] [3*, c1]\\nA project is “a temporary endeavor undertaken \\nto create a unique product, service, or result”. 1 \\nIn software engineering, different project types \\nare distinguished (e.g., product development, \\noutsourced services, software maintenance, ser -\\nvice creation, and so on). During its life cycle, a \\nsoftware product may require many projects. For \\nexample, during the product conception phase, \\na project might be conducted to determine the \\ncustomer need and market requirements; during \\nmaintenance, a project might be conducted to \\nproduce a next version of a product.\\n2.3. Program\\nA program is “a group of related projects, sub -\\nprograms, and program activities managed in a \\ncoordinated way to obtain benefits not available \\n1  Project Management Institute, Inc., PMI\\u2008Lexicon\\u2008\\nof\\u2008Project\\u2008Management\\u2008Terms,\\u20082012, www.pmi.org/\\nPMBOK-Guide-and-Standards/~/media/Registered/\\nPMI_Lexicon_Final.ashx .\\nfrom managing them individually.” 2 Programs \\nare often used to identify and manage different \\ndeliveries to a single customer or market over a \\ntime horizon of several years. \\n2.4. Portfolio\\nPortfolios are “projects, programs, subportfolios, \\nand operations managed as a group to achieve \\nstrategic objectives.”3 Portfolios are used to group \\nand then manage simultaneously all assets within \\na business line or organization. Looking to an \\nentire portfolio makes sure that impacts of deci -\\nsions are considered, such as resource allocation \\nto a specific project—which means that the same \\nresources are not available for other projects.\\n2.5. Product\\u2008Life\\u2008Cycle\\n[2*, c2] [3*, c2]\\nA software product life cycle (SPLC) includes \\nall activities needed to define, build, operate, \\nmaintain, and retire a software product or service \\nand its variants. The SPLC activities of “oper -\\nate,” “maintain,” and “retire” typically occur in \\na much longer time frame than initial software \\ndevelopment (the software development life \\ncycle—SDLC—see Software Life Cycle Mod -\\nels in the Software Engineering Process KA). \\nAlso the operate-maintain-retire activities of an \\nSPLC typically consume more total effort and \\nother resources than the SDLC activities (see \\nMajority of Maintenance Costs in the Software \\nMaintenance KA). The value contributed by a \\nsoftware product or associated services can be \\nobjectively determined during the “operate and \\nmaintain” time frame. Software engineering eco-\\nnomics should be concerned with all SPLC activ-\\nities, including the activities after initial product \\nrelease.\\n2.6. Project\\u2008Life\\u2008Cycle\\n[2*, c2] [3*, c2]\\nProject life cycle activities typically involve five \\nprocess groups—Initiating, Planning, Execut -\\ning, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing [4] \\n2  Ibid.\\n3  Ibid.')),\n",

For instance, agile \\nproduct development within an SPLC involves \\nmultiple iterations that produce increments of \\ndeliverable software. An SPLC should include \\nrisk management and synchronization with dif -\\nferent suppliers (if any), while providing audit -\\nable decision-making information (e.g., comply -\\ning with product liability needs or governance \\nregulations). The software project life cycle and \\nthe software product life cycle are interrelated; an \\nSPLC may include several SDLCs.\\n2.7.\\u2008Proposals\\n[1*, c3]\\nMaking a business decision begins with the \\nnotion of a proposal. Proposals relate to reaching \\na business objective—at the project, product, or \\nportfolio level. A proposal is a single, separate \\noption that is being considered, like carrying out \\na particular software development project or not. \\nAnother proposal could be to enhance an exist -\\ning software component, and still another might \\nbe to redevelop that same software from scratch. \\nEach proposal represents a unit of choice—either \\nyou can choose to carry out that proposal or you \\ncan choose not to. The whole purpose of business \\ndecision-making is to figure out, given the current \\nbusiness circumstances, which proposals should \\nbe carried out and which shouldn’t. \\n2.8.\\u2008Investment\\u2008Decisions\\n[1*, c4]\\nInvestors make investment decisions to spend \\nmoney and resources on achieving a target objec-\\ntive. Investors are either inside (e.g., finance, \\nboard) or outside (e.g., banks) the organization. \\nThe target relates to some economic criteria, such \\nas achieving a high return on the investment, \\nstrengthening the capabilities of the organization, \\nor improving the value of the company. Intangi -\\nble aspects such as goodwill, culture, and compe-\\ntences should be considered.\\n2.9.\\u2008Planning\\u2008Horizon\\n[1*, c11]\\nWhen an organization chooses to invest in a par -\\nticular proposal, money gets tied up in that pro -\\nposal—so-called “frozen assets.” The economic \\nimpact of frozen assets tends to start high and \\ndecreases over time. On the other hand, operat -\\ning and maintenance costs of elements associated \\nwith the proposal tend to start low but increase \\nover time. The total cost of the proposal—that \\nis, owning and operating a product—is the sum \\nof those two costs. Early on, frozen asset costs \\ndominate; later, the operating and maintenance \\ncosts dominate. There is a point in time where the \\nsum of the costs is minimized; this is called the \\nminimum\\u2008cost\\u2008lifetime.\\nTo properly compare a proposal with a four-\\nyear life span to a proposal with a six-year life \\nspan, the economic effects of either cutting the \\nsix-year proposal by two years or investing the \\nprofits from the four-year proposal for another \\ntwo years need to be addressed. The planning \\nhorizon, sometimes known as the study period, \\nis the consistent time frame over which propos -\\nals are considered. Effects such as software life -\\ntime will need to be factored into establishing a \\nplanning horizon. Once the planning horizon is \\nestablished, several techniques are available for \\nputting proposals with different life spans into \\nthat planning horizon.\\n2.10.\\u2008Price\\u2008and\\u2008Pricing\\n[1*, c13]\\nA price is what is paid in exchange for a good or \\nservice. Price is a fundamental aspect of financial \\nmodeling and is one of the four Ps of the marketing \\nmix. The other three Ps are product, promotion, \\nand place. Price is the only revenue-generating ele-\\nment amongst the four Ps; the rest are costs.\\nPricing is an element of finance and marketing. \\nIt is the process of determining what a company \\nwill receive in exchange for its products. Pricing \\nfactors include manufacturing cost, market place-\\nment, competition, market condition, and quality \\nof product. Pricing applies prices to products and \\nservices based on factors such as fixed amount, \\nquantity break, promotion or sales campaign, ')),\n",

The needs of the consumer can \\nbe converted into demand only if the consumer \\nhas the willingness and capacity to buy the prod-\\nuct. Thus, pricing is very important in marketing. \\nPricing is initially done during the project initia -\\ntion phase and is a part of “go” decision making.\\n2.11. Cost\\u2008and\\u2008Costing\\n[1*, c15]\\nA cost is the value of money that has been used up \\nto produce something and, hence, is not available \\nfor use anymore. In economics, a cost is an alter-\\nnative that is given up as a result of a decision. \\nA sunk cost is the expenses before a certain \\ntime, typically used to abstract decisions from \\nexpenses in the past, which can cause emotional \\nhurdles in looking forward. From a traditional \\neconomics point of view, sunk costs should not \\nbe considered in decision making. Opportunity \\ncost is the cost of an alternative that must be for -\\ngone in order to pursue another alternative.\\nCosting is part of finance and product manage-\\nment. It is the process to determine the cost based \\non expenses (e.g., production, software engineer-\\ning, distribution, rework) and on the target cost \\nto be competitive and successful in a market. \\nThe target cost can be below the actual estimated \\ncost. The planning and controlling of these costs \\n(called cost\\u2008management) is important and should \\nalways be included in costing. \\nAn important concept in costing is the total cost \\nof ownership (TCO). This holds especially for \\nsoftware, because there are many not-so-obvious \\ncosts related to SPLC activities after initial prod-\\nuct development. TCO for a software product is \\ndefined as the total cost for acquiring, activating, \\nand keeping that product running. These costs \\ncan be grouped as direct and indirect costs. TCO \\nis an accounting method that is crucial in making \\nsound economic decisions. \\n2.12. Performance\\u2008Measurement\\n[3*, c7, c8]\\nPerformance measurement is the process whereby \\nan organization establishes and measures the \\nparameters used to determine whether programs, \\ninvestments, and acquisitions are achieving the \\ndesired results. It is used to evaluate whether \\nperformance objectives are actually achieved; to \\ncontrol budgets, resources, progress, and deci -\\nsions; and to improve performance.\\n2.13. Earned\\u2008Value\\u2008Management\\n[3*, c8]\\nEarned value management (EVM) is a project \\nmanagement technique for measuring progress \\nbased on created value. At a given moment, the \\nresults achieved to date in a project are com -\\npared with the projected budget and the planned \\nschedule progress for that date. Progress relates \\nalready-consumed resources and achieved \\nresults at a given point in time with the respec -\\ntive planned values for the same date. It helps \\nto identify possible performance problems at an \\nearly stage. A key principle in EVM is tracking \\ncost and schedule variances via comparison of \\nplanned versus actual schedule and budget versus \\nactual cost. EVM tracking gives much earlier vis-\\nibility to deviations and thus permits corrections \\nearlier than classic cost and schedule tracking that \\nonly looks at delivered documents and products.\\n2.14. Termination\\u2008Decisions\\n[1*, c11, c12] [2*, c9]\\nTermination means to end a project or product. \\nTermination can be preplanned for the end of a \\nlong product lifetime (e.g., when foreseeing that a \\nproduct will reach its lifetime) or can come rather \\nspontaneously during product development \\n(e.g., when project performance targets are not \\nachieved). In both cases, the decision should be \\ncarefully prepared, considering always the alter -\\nnatives of continuing versus terminating. Costs of \\ndifferent alternatives must be estimated—cover -\\ning topics such as replacement, information col -\\nlection, suppliers, alternatives, assets, and utiliz -\\ning resources for other opportunities. Sunk costs \\nshould not be considered in such decision making \\nbecause they have been spent and will not reap -\\npear as a value.')),\n",

Replacement\\u2008and\\u2008Retirement\\u2008Decisions\\u2008\\n[1*, c12] [2*, c9]\\nA replacement decision is made when an organi -\\nzation already has a particular asset and they are \\nconsidering replacing it with something else; for \\nexample, deciding between maintaining and sup-\\nporting a legacy software product or redeveloping \\nit from the ground up. Replacement decisions use \\nthe same business decision process as described \\nabove, but there are additional challenges: sunk \\ncost and salvage value. Retirement decisions are \\nalso about getting out of an activity altogether, \\nsuch as when a software company considers not \\nselling a software product anymore or a hardware \\nmanufacturer considers not building and selling a \\nparticular model of computer any longer. Retire -\\nment decision can be influenced by lock-in fac -\\ntors such as technology dependency and high exit \\ncosts.\\n3. Risk and Uncertainty\\n3.1. Goals,\\u2008Estimates,\\u2008and\\u2008Plans\\n[3*, c6]\\nGoals in software engineering economics are \\nmostly business goals (or business objectives). \\nA business goal relates business needs (such as \\nincreasing profitability) to investing resources \\n(such as starting a project or launching a prod -\\nuct with a given budget, content, and timing). \\nGoals apply to operational planning (for instance, \\nto reach a certain milestone at a given date or to \\nextend software testing by some time to achieve a \\ndesired quality level—see Key Issues in the Soft-\\nware Testing KA) and to the strategic level (such \\nas reaching a certain profitability or market share \\nin a stated time period). \\nAn estimate is a well-founded evaluation of \\nresources and time that will be needed to achieve \\nstated goals (see Effort, Schedule, and Cost Esti-\\nmation in the Software Engineering Management \\nKA and Maintenance Cost Estimation in the Soft-\\nware Maintenance KA). A software estimate is \\nused to determine whether the project goals can \\nbe achieved within the constraints on schedule, \\nbudget, features, and quality attributes. Estimates \\nare typically internally generated and are not \\nnecessarily visible externally. Estimates should \\nnot be driven exclusively by the project goals \\nbecause this could make an estimate overly opti -\\nmistic. Estimation is a periodic activity; estimates \\nshould be continually revised during a project.\\nA plan describes the activities and milestones \\nthat are necessary in order to reach the goals of \\nFigure 12.4.

The \\nplan should be in line with the goal and the esti -\\nmate, which is not necessarily easy and obvi -\\nous—such as when a software project with given \\nrequirements would take longer than the target \\ndate foreseen by the client. In such cases, plans \\ndemand a review of initial goals as well as esti -\\nmates and the underlying uncertainties and inac -\\ncuracies. Creative solutions with the underlying \\nrationale of achieving a win-win position are \\napplied to resolve conflicts. \\nTo be of value, planning should involve con -\\nsideration of the project constraints and commit -\\nments to stakeholders. Figure 12.4 shows how \\ngoals are initially defined. Estimates are done \\nbased on the initial goals. The plan tries to match \\nthe goals and the estimates. This is an iterative \\nprocess, because an initial estimate typically does \\nnot meet the initial goals.\\n3.2. Estimation\\u2008Techniques\\n[3*, c6]\\nEstimations are used to analyze and forecast the \\nresources or time necessary to implement require-\\nments (see Effort, Schedule, and Cost Estimation \\nin the Software Engineering Management KA \\nand Maintenance Cost Estimation in the Software \\nMaintenance KA). Five families of estimation \\ntechniques exist:\\n• Expert judgment\\n• Analogy\\n• Estimation by parts\\n• Parametric methods\\n• Statistical methods.\\nNo single estimation technique is perfect, so \\nusing multiple estimation technique is useful. \\nConvergence among the estimates produced by \\ndifferent techniques indicates that the estimates \\nare probably accurate. Spread among the esti -\\nmates indicates that certain factors might have \\nbeen overlooked. Finding the factors that caused \\nthe spread and then reestimating again to pro -\\nduce results that converge could lead to a better \\nestimate.\\n3.3. Addressing\\u2008Uncertainty\\n[3*, c6]\\nBecause of the many unknown factors during \\nproject initiation and planning, estimates are \\ninherently uncertain; that uncertainty should be \\naddressed in business decisions. Techniques for \\naddressing uncertainty include\\n• consider ranges of estimates\\n• analyze sensitivity to changes of assumptions\\n• delay final decisions.\\n3.4. Prioritization\\n[3*, c6]\\nPrioritization involves ranking alternatives based \\non common criteria to deliver the best possible \\nvalue. In software engineering projects, software \\nrequirements are often prioritized in order to \\ndeliver the most value to the client within con -\\nstraints of schedule, budget, resources, and tech -\\nnology, or to provide for building product incre -\\nments, where the first increments provide the \\nhighest value to the customer (see Requirements \\nClassification and Requirements Negotiation in \\nthe Software Requirements KA and Software \\nLife Cycle Models in the Software Engineering \\nProcess KA). \\n3.5. Decisions\\u2008under\\u2008Risk\\n[1*, c24] [3*, c9]\\nDecisions under risk techniques are used when \\nthe decision maker can assign probabilities to the \\ndifferent possible outcomes (see Risk Manage -\\nment in the Software Engineering Management \\nKA).

Minimum\\u2008Acceptable\\u2008Rate\\u2008of\\u2008Return\\n[1*, c10]\\nThe minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR) \\nis the lowest internal rate of return the organi -\\nzation would consider to be a good investment. \\nGenerally speaking, it wouldn’t be smart to invest \\nin an activity with a return of 10% when there’s \\nanother activity that’s known to return 20%. \\nThe MARR is a statement that an organization \\nis confident it can achieve at least that rate of \\nreturn. The MARR represents the organization’s \\nopportunity cost for investments. By choosing \\nto invest in some activity, the organization is \\nexplicitly deciding to not invest that same money \\nsomewhere else. If the organization is already \\nconfident it can get some known rate of return, \\nother alternatives should be chosen only if their \\nrate of return is at least that high. A simple way \\nto account for that opportunity cost is to use the \\nMARR as the interest rate in business decisions. \\nAn alternative’s present worth evaluated at the \\nMARR shows how much more or less (in pres -\\nent-day cash terms) that alternative is worth than \\ninvesting at the MARR.\\n4.3. Return\\u2008on\\u2008Investment\\n[1*, c10]\\nReturn on investment (ROI) is a measure of the \\nprofitability of a company or business unit. It \\nis defined as the ratio of money gained or lost \\n(whether realized or unrealized) on an investment \\nrelative to the amount of money invested. The \\npurpose of ROI varies and includes, for instance, \\nproviding a rationale for future investments and \\nacquisition decisions.\\n4.4. Return\\u2008on\\u2008Capital\\u2008Employed\\nThe return on capital employed (ROCE) is a mea-\\nsure of the profitability of a company or business \\nunit. It is defined as the ratio of a gross profit \\nbefore taxes and interest (EBIT) to the total assets \\nminus current liabilities. It describes the return on \\nthe used capital.\\n4.5. Cost-Benefit\\u2008Analysis\\n[1*, c18]\\nCost-benefit analysis is one of the most widely \\nused methods for evaluating individual propos -\\nals. Any proposal with a benefit-cost ratio of less \\nthan 1.0 can usually be rejected without further \\nanalysis because it would cost more than the ben-\\nefit. Proposals with a higher ratio need to con -\\nsider the associated risk of an investment and \\ncompare the benefits with the option of investing \\nthe money at a guaranteed interest rate (see sec -\\ntion 4.2,  Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return).\\n4.6. Cost-Effectiveness\\u2008Analysis\\n[1*, c18]\\nCost-effectiveness analysis is similar to cost-\\nbenefit analysis. There are two versions of cost-\\neffectiveness analysis: the fixed-cost version \\nmaximizes the benefit given some upper bound \\non cost; the fixed-effectiveness version minimizes \\nthe cost needed to achieve a fixed goal.\\n4.7.\\u2008Break-Even\\u2008Analysis\\n[1*, c19]\\nBreak-even analysis identifies the point where \\nthe costs of developing a product and the revenue \\nto be generated are equal. Such an analysis can \\nbe used to choose between different proposals at \\ndifferent estimated costs and revenue. Given esti-\\nmated costs and revenue of two or more propos -\\nals, break-even analysis helps in choosing among \\nthem. \\n4.8.\\u2008Business\\u2008Case\\n[1*, c3]\\nThe business case is the consolidated information \\nsummarizing and explaining a business proposal \\nfrom different perspectives for a decision maker \\n(cost, benefit, risk, and so on). It is often used \\nto assess the potential value of a product, which \\ncan be used as a basis in the investment decision-\\nmaking process. As opposed to a mere profit-\\nloss calculation, the business case is a “case” of \\nplans and analyses that is owned by the product ')),\n",

Aside \\nfrom technical feasibility, money is almost \\nalways the most important decision criterion, but \\nit’s not always the only one. Quite often there are \\nother criteria, other “attributes,” that need to be \\nconsidered, and those attributes can’t be cast in \\nterms of money. Multiple attribute decision tech-\\nniques allow other, nonfinancial criteria to be fac-\\ntored into the decision.\\nThere are two families of multiple attribute \\ndecision techniques that differ in how they use \\nthe attributes in the decision. One family is the \\n“compensatory,” or single-dimensioned, tech -\\nniques. This family collapses all of the attributes \\nonto a single figure of merit. The family is called \\ncompensatory because, for any given alternative, \\na lower score in one attribute can be compensated \\nby—or traded off against—a higher score in other \\nattributes. The compensatory techniques include\\n• nondimensional scaling\\n• additive weighting\\n• analytic hierarchy process.\\nIn contrast, the other family is the “noncom -\\npensatory,” or fully dimensioned, techniques. \\nThis family does not allow tradeoffs among the \\nattributes. Each attribute is treated as a separate \\nentity in the decision process. The noncompensa-\\ntory techniques include\\n• dominance\\n• satisficing\\n• lexicography.\\n4.10.\\u2008Optimization\\u2008Analysis\\n[1*, c20]\\nThe typical use of optimization analysis is to \\nstudy a cost function over a range of values to \\nfind the point where overall performance is best. \\nSoftware’s classic space-time tradeoff is an \\nexample of optimization; an algorithm that runs \\nfaster will often use more memory. Optimization \\nbalances the value of the faster runtime against \\nthe cost of the additional memory.\\nReal options analysis can be used to quantify \\nthe value of project choices, including the value \\nof delaying a decision. Such options are difficult \\nto compute with precision. However, awareness \\nthat choices have a monetary value provides \\ninsight in the timing of decisions such as increas-\\ning project staff or lengthening time to market to \\nimprove quality. \\n5. Practical Considerations\\n5.1. The\\u2008“Good\\u2008Enough”\\u2008Principle\\n[1*, c21]\\nOften software engineering projects and products \\nare not precise about the targets that should be \\nachieved. Software requirements are stated, but \\nthe marginal value of adding a bit more function-\\nality cannot be measured. The result could be late \\ndelivery or too-high cost. The “good enough” \\nprinciple relates marginal value to marginal cost \\nand provides guidance to determine criteria when \\na deliverable is “good enough” to be delivered. \\nThese criteria depend on business objectives and \\non prioritization of different alternatives, such as \\nranking software requirements, measurable qual-\\nity attributes, or relating schedule to product con-\\ntent and cost. \\nThe RACE principle (reduce accidents and \\ncontrol essence) is a popular rule towards good \\nenough software. Accidents imply unnecessary \\noverheads such as gold-plating and rework due \\nto late defect removal or too many requirements \\nchanges. Essence is what customers pay for. Soft-\\nware engineering economics provides the mech -\\nanisms to define criteria that determine when a \\ndeliverable is “good enough” to be delivered. \\nIt also highlights that both words are relevant: \\n“good” and “enough.” Insufficient quality or \\ninsufficient quantity is not good enough.\\nAgile methods are examples of “good enough” \\nthat try to optimize value by reducing the over -\\nhead of delayed rework and the gold plating that ')),\n",

In agile meth -\\nods, detailed planning and lengthy development \\nphases are replaced by incremental planning and \\nfrequent delivery of small increments of a deliv -\\nerable product that is tested and evaluated by user \\nrepresentatives. \\n5.2. Friction-Free\\u2008Economy\\nEconomic friction is everything that keeps mar -\\nkets from having perfect competition. It involves \\ndistance, cost of delivery, restrictive regulations, \\nand/or imperfect information. In high-friction \\nmarkets, customers don’t have many suppliers \\nfrom which to choose. Having been in a business \\nfor a while or owning a store in a good location \\ndetermines the economic position. It’s hard for \\nnew competitors to start business and compete. \\nThe marketplace moves slowly and predictably. \\nFriction-free markets are just the reverse. New \\ncompetitors emerge and customers are quick to \\nrespond. The marketplace is anything but predict-\\nable. Theoretically, software and IT are friction-\\nfree. New companies can easily create products \\nand often do so at a much lower cost than estab -\\nlished companies, since they need not consider \\nany legacies. Marketing and sales can be done \\nvia the Internet and social networks, and basi -\\ncally free distribution mechanisms can enable a \\nramp up to a global business. Software engineer-\\ning economics aims to provide foundations to \\njudge how a software business performs and how \\nfriction-free a market actually is. For instance, \\ncompetition among software app developers is \\ninhibited when apps must be sold through an app \\nstore and comply with that store’s rules.\\n5.3. Ecosystems\\nAn ecosystem is an environment consisting of all \\nthe mutually dependent stakeholders, business \\nunits, and companies working in a particular area. \\nIn a typical ecosystem, there are producers and \\nconsumers, where the consumers add value to \\nthe consumed resources. Note that a consumer is \\nnot the end user but an organization that uses the \\nproduct to enhance it. A software ecosystem is, \\nfor instance, a supplier of an application working \\nwith companies doing the installation and sup -\\nport in different regions. Neither one could exist \\nwithout the other. Ecosystems can be permanent \\nor temporary. Software engineering economics \\nprovides the mechanisms to evaluate alternatives \\nin establishing or extending an ecosystem—for \\ninstance, assessing whether to work with a spe -\\ncific distributor or have the distribution done by a \\ncompany doing service in an area.\\n5.4. Offshoring\\u2008and\\u2008Outsourcing\\nOffshoring means executing a business activity \\nbeyond sales and marketing outside the home \\ncountry of an enterprise. Enterprises typically \\neither have their offshoring branches in low-\\ncost countries or they ask specialized companies \\nabroad to execute the respective activity. Offshor-\\ning should therefore not be confused with out -\\nsourcing. Offshoring within a company is called \\ncaptive offshoring. Outsourcing is the result-ori -\\nented relationship with a supplier who executes \\nbusiness activities for an enterprise when, tra -\\nditionally, those activities were executed inside \\nthe enterprise. Outsourcing is site-independent. \\nThe supplier can reside in the neighborhood of \\nthe enterprise or offshore (outsourced offshor -\\ning). Software engineering economics provides \\nthe basic criteria and business tools to evaluate \\ndifferent sourcing mechanisms and control their \\nperformance. For instance, using an outsourcing \\nsupplier for software development and mainte -\\nnance might reduce the cost per hour of software \\ndevelopment, but increase the number of hours \\nand capital expenses due to an increased need for \\nmonitoring and communication. (For more infor-\\nmation on offshoring and outsourcing, see “Out -\\nsourcing” in Management Issues in the Software \\nMaintenance KA.)')),\n",

Such \\ncourses include programming, data structure, \\nalgorithms, computer organization, operating \\nsystems, compilers, databases, networking, dis -\\ntributed systems, and so forth. Thus, when break-\\ning down topics, it can be tempting to decompose \\nthe Computing Foundations KA according to \\nthese often-found divisions in relevant courses. \\nHowever, a purely course-based division of \\ntopics suffers serious drawbacks. For one, not \\nall courses in computer science are related or \\nequally important to software engineering. Thus, \\nsome topics that would otherwise be covered in a \\ncomputer science course are not covered in this \\nKA. For example, computer graphics—while an \\nimportant course in a computer science degree \\nprogram—is not included in this KA. \\nSecond, some topics discussed in this guide -\\nline do not exist as standalone courses in under -\\ngraduate or graduate computer science programs. \\nConsequently, such topics may not be adequately \\ncovered in a purely course-based breakdown. For \\nexample, abstraction is a topic incorporated into \\nseveral different computer science courses; it is \\nunclear which course abstraction should belong \\nto in a course-based breakdown of topics.\\nThe Computing Foundations KA is divided into \\nseventeen different topics. A topic’s direct useful-\\nness to software engineers is the criterion used for \\nselecting topics for inclusion in this KA (see Figure \\n13.1). The advantage of this topic-based breakdown \\nis its foundation on the belief that Computing Foun-\\ndations—if it is to be grasped firmly—must be con-\\nsidered as a collection of logically connected topics \\nundergirding software engineering in general and \\nsoftware construction in particular. \\nThe Computing Foundations KA is related \\nclosely to the Software Design, Software Con -\\nstruction, Software Testing, Software Main -\\ntenance, Software Quality, and Mathematical \\nFoundations KAs.\\nBREAKDOWN OF TOPICS FOR \\nCOMPUTING FOUNDATIONS\\nThe breakdown of topics for the Computing \\nFoundations KA is shown in Figure 13.1.\\nFigure 13.1.

Problem Solving Techniques\\n[2*, s3.2, c4] [3*, c5]\\nThe concepts, notions, and terminology introduced \\nhere form an underlying basis for understanding \\nthe role and scope of problem solving techniques.\\n1.1. Definition\\u2008of\\u2008Problem\\u2008Solving\\nProblem solving refers to the thinking and activi-\\nties conducted to answer or derive a solution to \\na problem. There are many ways to approach a \\nproblem, and each way employs different tools \\nand uses different processes. These different \\nways of approaching problems gradually expand \\nand define themselves and finally give rise to dif-\\nferent disciplines. For example, software engi -\\nneering focuses on solving problems using com -\\nputers and software. \\nWhile different problems warrant different \\nsolutions and may require different tools and \\nprocesses, the methodology and techniques used \\nin solving problems do follow some guidelines \\nand can often be generalized as problem solving \\ntechniques. For example, a general guideline for \\nsolving a generic engineering problem is to use \\nthe three-step process given below [2*].\\n• Formulate the real problem.\\n• Analyze the problem.\\n• Design a solution search strategy.\\n1.2. Formulating\\u2008the\\u2008Real\\u2008Problem\\nGerard Voland writes, “It is important to recog -\\nnize that a specific problem should be formulated \\nif one is to develop a specific solution” [2*]. \\nThis formulation is called the problem statement, \\nwhich explicitly specifies what both the problem \\nand the desired outcome are. \\nAlthough there is no universal way of stat -\\ning a problem, in general a problem should be \\nexpressed in such a way as to facilitate the devel-\\nopment of solutions. Some general techniques \\nto help one formulate the real problem include \\nstatement-restatement, determining the source \\nand the cause, revising the statement, analyzing \\npresent and desired state, and using the fresh eye \\napproach.\\n1.3. Analyze\\u2008the\\u2008Problem\\nOnce the problem statement is available, the next \\nstep is to analyze the problem statement or situ -\\nation to help structure our search for a solution. \\nFour types of analysis include situation\\u2008analysis, \\nin which the most urgent or critical aspects of a \\nsituation are identified first; problem\\u2008analysis, in \\nwhich the cause of the problem must be deter -\\nmined; decision\\u2008analysis, in which the action(s) \\nneeded to correct the problem or eliminate its \\ncause must be determined; and potential\\u2008problem\\u2008\\nanalysis, in which the action(s) needed to prevent \\nany reoccurrences of the problem or the develop-\\nment of new problems must be determined.\\n1.4. Design\\u2008a\\u2008Solution\\u2008Search\\u2008Strategy\\nOnce the problem analysis is complete, we can \\nfocus on structuring a search strategy to find the \\nsolution. In order to find the “best” solution (here, \\n“best” could mean different things to different \\npeople, such as faster, cheaper, more usable, dif -\\nferent capabilities, etc.), we need to eliminate \\npaths that do not lead to viable solutions, design \\ntasks in a way that provides the most guidance in \\nsearching for a solution, and use various attributes \\nof the final solution state to guide our choices in \\nthe problem solving process.\\n1.5. Problem\\u2008Solving\\u2008Using\\u2008Programs\\nThe uniqueness of computer software gives prob-\\nlem solving a flavor that is distinct from general \\nengineering problem solving. To solve a problem \\nusing computers, we must answer the following \\nquestions.\\n• How do we figure out what to tell the com -\\nputer to do?\\n• How do we convert the problem statement \\ninto an algorithm?\\n• How do we convert the algorithm into \\nmachine instructions?\\nThe first task in solving a problem using a com-\\nputer is to determine what to tell the computer to \\ndo. There may be many ways to tell the story, but \\nall should take the perspective of a computer such ')),\n",

In general, a problem should be expressed \\nin such a way as to facilitate the development of \\nalgorithms and data structures for solving it. \\nThe result of the first task is a problem state -\\nment. The next step is to convert the problem state-\\nment into algorithms that solve the problem. Once \\nan algorithm is found, the final step converts the \\nalgorithm into machine instructions that form the \\nfinal solution: software that solves the problem. \\nAbstractly speaking, problem solving using a \\ncomputer can be considered as a process of prob-\\nlem transformation—in other words, the step-by-\\nstep transformation of a problem statement into \\na problem solution. To the discipline of software \\nengineering, the ultimate objective of problem \\nsolving is to transform a problem expressed in \\nnatural language into electrons running around \\na circuit. In general, this transformation can be \\nbroken into three phases:\\na) Development of algorithms from the prob -\\nlem statement.\\nb) Application of algorithms to the problem.\\nc) Transformation of algorithms to program \\ncode. \\nThe conversion of a problem statement into \\nalgorithms and algorithms into program codes \\nusually follows a “stepwise refinement” (a.k.a. \\nsystematic decomposition) in which we start \\nwith a problem statement, rewrite it as a task, \\nand recursively decompose the task into a few \\nsimpler subtasks until the task is so simple that \\nsolutions to it are straightforward. There are three \\nbasic ways of decomposing: sequential, condi -\\ntional, and iterative. \\n2. Abstraction\\n[3*, s5.2–5.4]\\nAbstraction is an indispensible technique associ -\\nated with problem solving. It refers to both the \\nprocess and result of generalization by reducing \\nthe information of a concept, a problem, or an \\nobservable phenomenon so that one can focus \\non the “big picture.” One of the most important \\nskills in any engineering undertaking is framing \\nthe levels of abstraction appropriately. \\n“Through abstraction,” according to V oland, \\n“we view the problem and its possible solution \\npaths from a higher level of conceptual under -\\nstanding. As a result, we may become better pre-\\npared to recognize possible relationships between \\ndifferent aspects of the problem and thereby gen-\\nerate more creative design solutions” [2*]. This \\nis particularly true in computer science in general \\n(such as hardware vs. software) and in software \\nengineering in particular (data structure vs. data \\nflow, and so forth). \\n2.1. Levels\\u2008of\\u2008Abstraction\\nWhen abstracting, we concentrate on one “level” \\nof the big picture at a time with confidence that \\nwe can then connect effectively with levels above \\nand below. Although we focus on one level, \\nabstraction does not mean knowing nothing about \\nthe neighboring levels. Abstraction levels do not \\nnecessarily correspond to discrete components \\nin reality or in the problem domain, but to well-\\ndefined standard interfaces such as programming \\nAPIs. The advantages that standard interfaces \\nprovide include portability, easier software/hard-\\nware integration and wider usage.\\n2.2. Encapsulation\\nEncapsulation is a mechanism used to imple -\\nment abstraction. When we are dealing with one \\nlevel of abstraction, the information concerning \\nthe levels below and above that level is encapsu -\\nlated. This information can be the concept, prob -\\nlem, or observable phenomenon; or it may be the \\npermissible operations on these relevant entities. \\nEncapsulation usually comes with some degree \\nof information hiding in which some or all of \\nthe underlying details are hidden from the level \\nabove the interface provided by the abstraction. \\nTo an object, information hiding means we don’t \\nneed to know the details of how the object is rep-\\nresented or how the operations on those objects \\nare implemented.\\n2.3. Hierarchy\\nWhen we use abstraction in our problem formula-\\ntion and solution, we may use different abstractions ')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 227}, page_content='Computing Foundations 13-5\\nat different times—in other words, we work on dif-\\nferent levels of abstraction as the situation calls. \\nMost of the time, these different levels of abstrac-\\ntion are organized in a hierarchy. There are many \\nways to structure a particular hierarchy and the \\ncriteria used in determining the specific content of \\neach layer in the hierarchy varies depending on the \\nindividuals performing the work. \\nSometimes, a hierarchy of abstraction is sequen-\\ntial, which means that each layer has one and only \\none predecessor (lower) layer and one and only \\none successor (upper) layer—except the upmost \\nlayer (which has no successor) and the bottommost \\nlayer (which has no predecessor). Sometimes, \\nhowever, the hierarchy is organized in a tree-like \\nstructure, which means each layer can have more \\nthan one predecessor layer but only one successor \\nlayer. Occasionally, a hierarchy can have a many-\\nto-many structure, in which each layer can have \\nmultiple predecessors and successors. At no time, \\nshall there be any loop in a hierarchy. \\nA hierarchy often forms naturally in task decom-\\nposition. Often, a task analysis can be decomposed \\nin a hierarchical fashion, starting with the larger \\ntasks and goals of the organization and breaking \\neach of them down into smaller subtasks that can \\nagain be further subdivided This continuous divi-\\nsion of tasks into smaller ones would produce a \\nhierarchical structure of tasks-subtasks. \\n2.4. Alternate\\u2008Abstractions\\nSometimes it is useful to have multiple alternate \\nabstractions for the same problem so that one can \\nkeep different perspectives in mind. For exam -\\nple, we can have a class diagram, a state chart, \\nand a sequence diagram for the same software \\nat the same level of abstraction. These alternate \\nabstractions do not form a hierarchy but rather \\ncomplement each other in helping understanding \\nthe problem and its solution. Though beneficial, it \\nis as times difficult to keep alternate abstractions \\nin sync.\\n3. Programming Fundamentals\\n[3*, c6–19]\\nProgramming is composed of the methodologies \\nor activities for creating computer programs that \\nperform a desired function. It is an indispensible \\npart in software construction. In general, pro -\\ngramming can be considered as the process of \\ndesigning, writing, testing, debugging, and main-\\ntaining the source code. This source code is writ-\\nten in a programming language. \\nThe process of writing source code often \\nrequires expertise in many different subject \\nareas—including knowledge of the application \\ndomain, appropriate data structures, special -\\nized algorithms, various language constructs, \\ngood programming techniques, and software \\nengineering. \\n3.1. The\\u2008Programming\\u2008Process\\nProgramming involves design, writing, testing, \\ndebugging, and maintenance. Design is the con -\\nception or invention of a scheme for turning a \\ncustomer requirement for computer software into \\noperational software. It is the activity that links \\napplication requirements to coding and debug -\\nging. Writing is the actual coding of the design \\nin an appropriate programming language. Testing \\nis the activity to verify that the code one writes \\nactually does what it is supposed to do. Debug-\\nging is the activity to find and fix bugs (faults) in \\nthe source code (or design). Maintenance is the \\nactivity to update, correct, and enhance existing \\nprograms. Each of these activities is a huge topic \\nand often warrants the explanation of an entire \\nKA in the SWEBOK Guide and many books.\\n3.2. Programming\\u2008Paradigms\\nProgramming is highly creative and thus some -\\nwhat personal. Different people often write dif -\\nferent programs for the same requirements. This \\ndiversity of programming causes much difficulty \\nin the construction and maintenance of large \\ncomplex software. Various programming para -\\ndigms have been developed over the years to put \\nsome standardization into this highly creative and \\npersonal activity. When one programs, he or she \\ncan use one of several programming paradigms to \\nwrite the code. The major types of programming \\nparadigms are discussed below.\\nUnstructured\\u2008Programming:\\u2008In unstructured \\nprogramming, a programmer follows his/her ')),\n",

Often, \\nthe practice is to write code to fulfill a specific \\nutility without regard to anything else. Programs \\nwritten this way exhibit no particular structure—\\nthus the name “unstructured programming.” \\nUnstructured programming is also sometimes \\ncalled ad hoc programming.\\nStructured/Procedural/\\u2008Imperative\\u2008 Program-\\nming:\\u2008A hallmark of structured programming is \\nthe use of well-defined control structures, includ-\\ning procedures (and/or functions) with each pro -\\ncedure (or function) performing a specific task. \\nInterfaces exist between procedures to facilitate \\ncorrect and smooth calling operations of the pro -\\ngrams. Under structured programming, program-\\nmers often follow established protocols and rules \\nof thumb when writing code. These protocols \\nand rules can be numerous and cover almost the \\nentire scope of programming—ranging from the \\nsimplest issue (such as how to name variables, \\nfunctions, procedures, and so forth) to more com-\\nplex issues (such as how to structure an interface, \\nhow to handle exceptions, and so forth). \\nObject-Oriented\\u2008Programming:\\u2008While proce -\\ndural programming organizes programs around \\nprocedures, object-oriented programming (OOP) \\norganize a program around objects, which are \\nabstract data structures that combine both data \\nand methods used to access or manipulate the \\ndata. The primary features of OOP are that objects \\nrepresenting various abstract and concrete entities \\nare created and these objects interact with each \\nother to collectively fulfill the desired functions.\\nAspect-Oriented\\u2008 Programming:\\u2008 Aspect-ori-\\nented programming (AOP) is a programming \\nparadigm that is built on top of OOP. AOP aims \\nto isolate secondary or supporting functions from \\nthe main program’s business logic by focusing \\non the cross sections (concerns) of the objects. \\nThe primary motivation for AOP is to resolve \\nthe object tangling and scattering associated with \\nOOP, in which the interactions among objects \\nbecome very complex. The essence of AOP is \\nthe greatly emphasized separation of concerns, \\nwhich separates noncore functional concerns or \\nlogic into various aspects.\\nFunctional\\u2008Programming: Though less popu -\\nlar, functional programming is as viable as \\nthe other paradigms in solving programming \\nproblems. In functional programming, all com -\\nputations are treated as the evaluation of math -\\nematical functions. In contrast to the imperative \\nprogramming that emphasizes changes in state, \\nfunctional programming emphasizes the applica-\\ntion of functions, avoids state and mutable data, \\nand provides referential transparency.\\n4. Programming Language Basics\\n[4*, c6]\\nUsing computers to solve problems involves \\nprogramming—which is writing and organiz -\\ning instructions telling the computer what to do \\nat each step. Programs must be written in some \\nprogramming language with which and through \\nwhich we describe necessary computations. In \\nother words, we use the facilities provided by a \\nprogramming language to describe problems, \\ndevelop algorithms, and reason about problem \\nsolutions. To write any program, one must under-\\nstand at least one programming language.\\n4.1. Programming\\u2008Language\\u2008Overview\\nA programming language is designed to express \\ncomputations that can be performed by a com -\\nputer. In a practical sense, a programming lan -\\nguage is a notation for writing programs and thus \\nshould be able to express most data structures and \\nalgorithms. Some, but not all, people restrict the \\nterm “programming language” to those languages \\nthat can express all possible algorithms.\\nNot all languages have the same importance \\nand popularity. The most popular ones are often \\ndefined by a specification document established \\nby a well-known and respected organization. For \\nexample, the C programming language is speci -\\nfied by an ISO standard named ISO/IEC 9899. \\nOther languages, such as Perl and Python, do not \\nenjoy such treatment and often have a dominant \\nimplementation that is used as a reference. \\n4.2. Syntax\\u2008and\\u2008Semantics\\u2008of\\u2008Programming\\u2008\\nLanguages\\nJust like natural languages, many programming \\nlanguages have some form of written specifica -\\ntion of their syntax (form) and semantics (mean -\\ning). Such specifications include, for example, ')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 229}, page_content='Computing Foundations 13-7\\nspecific requirements for the definition of vari -\\nables and constants (in other words, declara -\\ntion and types) and format requirements for the \\ninstructions themselves. \\nIn general, a programming language supports \\nsuch constructs as variables, data types, con -\\nstants, literals, assignment statements, control \\nstatements, procedures, functions, and comments. \\nThe syntax and semantics of each construct must \\nbe clearly specified.\\n4.3. Low-Level\\u2008Programming\\u2008Languages\\nProgramming language can be classified into two \\nclasses: low-level languages and high-level lan -\\nguages. Low-level languages can be understood \\nby a computer with no or minimal assistance and \\ntypically include machine languages and assem -\\nbly languages. A machine language uses ones \\nand zeros to represent instructions and variables, \\nand is directly understandable by a computer. An \\nassembly language contains the same instructions \\nas a machine language but the instructions and \\nvariables have symbolic names that are easier for \\nhumans to remember. \\nAssembly languages cannot be directly under -\\nstood by a computer and must be translated into a \\nmachine language by a utility program called an \\nassembler. There often exists a correspondence \\nbetween the instructions of an assembly language \\nand a machine language, and the translation from \\nassembly code to machine code is straightfor -\\nward. For example, “add r1, r2, r3” is an assem -\\nbly instruction for adding the content of register \\nr2 and r3 and storing the sum into register r1. This \\ninstruction can be easily translated into machine \\ncode “0001 0001 0010 0011.” (Assume the oper-\\nation code for addition is 0001, see Figure 13.2).\\nadd r1, r2, r3\\n0001 0001 0010 0011\\nFigure 13.2. Assembly-to-Binary Translations\\nOne common trait shared by these two types \\nof language is their close association with the \\nspecifics of a type of computer or instruction set \\narchitecture (ISA).\\n4.4. High-Level\\u2008Programming\\u2008Languages\\nA high-level programming language has a strong \\nabstraction from the details of the computer’s \\nISA. In comparison to low-level programming \\nlanguages, it often uses natural-language ele -\\nments and is thus much easier for humans to \\nunderstand. Such languages allow symbolic nam-\\ning of variables, provide expressiveness, and \\nenable abstraction of the underlying hardware. \\nFor example, while each microprocessor has its \\nown ISA, code written in a high-level program -\\nming language is usually portable between many \\ndifferent hardware platforms. For these reasons, \\nmost programmers use and most software are \\nwritten in high-level programming languages. \\nExamples of high-level programming languages \\ninclude C, C++, C#, and Java.\\n4.5. Declarative\\u2008vs.\\u2008Imperative\\u2008Programming\\u2008\\nLanguages\\nMost programming languages (high-level or low-\\nlevel) allow programmers to specify the indi -\\nvidual instructions that a computer is to execute. \\nSuch programming languages are called impera -\\ntive programming languages because one has to \\nspecify every step clearly to the computer. But \\nsome programming languages allow program -\\nmers to only describe the function to be per -\\nformed without specifying the exact instruction \\nsequences to be executed. Such programming \\nlanguages are called declarative programming \\nlanguages. Declarative languages are high-level \\nlanguages. The actual implementation of the \\ncomputation written in such a language is hidden \\nfrom the programmers and thus is not a concern \\nfor them. \\nThe key point to note is that declarative pro -\\ngramming only describes what the program \\nshould accomplish without describing how to \\naccomplish it. For this reason, many people \\nbelieve declarative programming facilitates \\neasier software development. Declarative pro -\\ngramming languages include Lisp (also a func -\\ntional programming language) and Prolog, while \\nimperative programming languages include C, \\nC++, and JA V A.')),\n",

Debugging Tools and Techniques\\n[3*, c23]\\nOnce a program is coded and compiled (compila-\\ntion will be discussed in section 10), the next step \\nis debugging, which is a methodical process of \\nfinding and reducing the number of bugs or faults \\nin a program. The purpose of debugging is to find \\nout why a program doesn’t work or produces a \\nwrong result or output. Except for very simple \\nprograms, debugging is always necessary. \\n5.1. Types\\u2008of\\u2008Errors\\nWhen a program does not work, it is often because \\nthe program contains bugs or errors that can be \\neither syntactic errors, logical errors, or data errors. \\nLogical errors and data errors are also known as \\ntwo categories of “faults” in software engineering \\nterminology (see topic 1.1, Testing-Related Ter -\\nminology, in the Software Testing KA).\\nSyntax\\u2008errors are simply any error that pre -\\nvents the translator (compiler/interpreter) from \\nsuccessfully parsing the statement. Every state -\\nment in a program must be parse-able before its \\nmeaning can be understood and interpreted (and, \\ntherefore, executed). In high-level programming \\nlanguages, syntax errors are caught during the \\ncompilation or translation from the high-level \\nlanguage into machine code. For example, in the \\nC/C++ programming language, the statement \\n“123=constant;” contains a syntax error that will \\nbe caught by the compiler during compilation.\\nLogic\\u2008errors are semantic errors that result in \\nincorrect computations or program behaviors. \\nYour program is legal, but wrong! So the results \\ndo not match the problem statement or user expec-\\ntations. For example, in the C/C++ programming \\nlanguage, the inline function “int f(int x) {return \\nf(x-1);}” for computing factorial x! is legal but \\nlogically incorrect. This type of error cannot be \\ncaught by a compiler during compilation and is \\noften discovered through tracing the execution of \\nthe program (Modern static checkers do identify \\nsome of these errors. However, the point remains \\nthat these are not machine checkable in general).\\nData\\u2008errors are input errors that result either in \\ninput data that is different from what the program \\nexpects or in the processing of wrong data. \\n5.2. Debugging\\u2008Techniques\\nDebugging involves many activities and can be \\nstatic, dynamic, or postmortem. Static\\u2008debug-\\nging usually takes the form of code review, while \\ndynamic\\u2008debugging usually takes the form of \\ntracing and is closely associated with testing. \\nPostmortem\\u2008debugging is the act of debugging \\nthe core dump (memory dump) of a process. Core \\ndumps are often generated after a process has ter-\\nminated due to an unhandled exception. All three \\ntechniques are used at various stages of program \\ndevelopment.\\nThe main activity of dynamic debugging is \\ntracing, which is executing the program one piece \\nat a time, examining the contents of registers and \\nmemory, in order to examine the results at each \\nstep. There are three ways to trace a program.\\n• Single-stepping:\\u2008execute one instruction at \\na time to make sure each instruction is exe -\\ncuted correctly. This method is tedious but \\nuseful in verifying each step of a program.\\n• Breakpoints:\\u2008tell the program to stop execut-\\ning when it reaches a specific instruction. \\nThis technique lets one quickly execute \\nselected code sequences to get a high-level \\noverview of the execution behavior. \\n• Watch\\u2008points:\\u2008tell the program to stop when a \\nregister or memory location changes or when \\nit equals to a specific value. This technique \\nis useful when one doesn’t know where or \\nwhen a value is changed and when this value \\nchange likely causes the error.\\n5.3. Debugging\\u2008Tools\\nDebugging can be complex, difficult, and tedious. \\nLike programming, debugging is also highly cre-\\native (sometimes more creative than program -\\nming). Thus some help from tools is in order. For \\ndynamic debugging, debuggers are widely used \\nand enable the programmer to monitor the execu-\\ntion of a program, stop the execution, restart the \\nexecution, set breakpoints, change values in mem-\\nory, and even, in some cases, go back in time. \\nFor static debugging, there are many static\\u2008\\ncode\\u2008analysis\\u2008tools, which look for a specific \\nset of known problems within the source code.

These tools can be extremely useful \\nwhen checking very large source trees, where it is \\nimpractical to do code walkthroughs. The UNIX \\nlint program is an early example.\\n6. Data Structure and Representation\\n[5*, s2.1–2.6]\\nPrograms work on data. But data must be \\nexpressed and organized within computers before \\nbeing processed by programs. This organization \\nand expression of data for programs’ use is the \\nsubject of data structure and representation. Sim-\\nply put, a data structure tries to store and organize \\ndata in a computer in such a way that the data can \\nbe used efficiently. There are many types of data \\nstructures and each type of structure is suitable \\nfor some kinds of applications. For example, B/\\nB+ trees are well suited for implementing mas -\\nsive file systems and databases.\\n6.1. Data\\u2008Structure\\u2008Overview\\nData structures are computer representations of \\ndata. Data structures are used in almost every pro-\\ngram. In a sense, no meaningful program can be \\nconstructed without the use of some sort of data \\nstructure. Some design methods and program -\\nming languages even organize an entire software \\nsystem around data structures. Fundamentally, \\ndata structures are abstractions defined on a col -\\nlection of data and its associated operations. \\nOften, data structures are designed for improv-\\ning program or algorithm efficiency. Examples of \\nsuch data structures include stacks, queues, and \\nheaps. At other times, data structures are used for \\nconceptual unity (abstract data type), such as the \\nname and address of a person. Often, a data struc-\\nture can determine whether a program runs in a \\nfew seconds or in a few hours or even a few days. \\nFrom the perspective of physical and logi -\\ncal ordering, a data structure is either linear or \\nnonlinear. Other perspectives give rise to dif -\\nferent classifications that include homogeneous \\nvs. heterogeneous, static vs. dynamic, persistent \\nvs. transient, external vs. internal, primitive vs. \\naggregate, recursive vs. nonrecursive; passive vs. \\nactive; and stateful vs. stateless structures.\\n6.2. Types\\u2008of\\u2008Data\\u2008Structure\\nAs mentioned above, different perspectives can \\nbe used to classify data structures. However, the \\npredominant perspective used in classification \\ncenters on physical and logical ordering between \\ndata items. This classification divides data struc -\\ntures into linear and nonlinear structures. Linear \\nstructures organize data items in a single dimen -\\nsion in which each data entry has one (physical \\nor logical) predecessor and one successor with \\nthe exception of the first and last entry. The first \\nentry has no predecessor and the last entry has \\nno successor. Nonlinear structures organize data \\nitems in two or more dimensions, in which case \\none entry can have multiple predecessors and \\nsuccessors. Examples of linear structures include \\nlists, stacks, and queues. Examples of nonlinear \\nstructures include heaps, hash tables, and trees \\n(such as binary trees, balance trees, B-trees, and \\nso forth). \\nAnother type of data structure that is often \\nencountered in programming is the compound \\nstructure. A compound data structure builds on \\ntop of other (more primitive) data structures and, \\nin some way, can be viewed as the same structure \\nas the underlying structure. Examples of com -\\npound structures include sets, graphs, and parti -\\ntions. For example, a partition can be viewed as \\na set of sets.\\n6.3. Operations\\u2008on\\u2008Data\\u2008Structures\\nAll data structures support some operations that \\nproduce a specific structure and ordering, or \\nretrieve relevant data from the structure, store data \\ninto the structure, or delete data from the structure. \\nBasic operations supported by all data structures \\ninclude create, read, update, and delete (CRUD).\\n• Create: Insert a new data entry into the \\nstructure.\\n• Read: Retrieve a data entry from the structure.\\n• Update: Modify an existing data entry.\\n• Delete: Remove a data entry from the \\nstructure.\\nSome data structures also support additional \\noperations:')),\n",

The difference \\nbetween operation efficiency can be significant. \\nFor example, it is easy to retrieve the last item \\ninserted into a stack, but finding a particular ele -\\nment within a stack is rather slow and tedious.\\n7. Algorithms and Complexity\\n[5*, s1.1–1.3, s3.3–3.6, s4.1–4.8, s5.1–5.7, \\ns6.1–6.3, s7.1–7.6, s11.1, s12.1]\\nPrograms are not random pieces of code: they are \\nmeticulously written to perform user-expected \\nactions. The guide one uses to compose programs \\nare algorithms, which organize various functions \\ninto a series of steps and take into consideration \\nthe application domain, the solution strategy, and \\nthe data structures being used. An algorithm can \\nbe very simple or very complex. \\n7.1.\\u2008Overview\\u2008of\\u2008Algorithms\\nAbstractly speaking, algorithms guide the opera -\\ntions of computers and consist of a sequence of \\nactions composed to solve a problem. Alternative \\ndefinitions include but are not limited to:\\n• An algorithm is any well-defined computa -\\ntional procedure that takes some value or set \\nof values as input and produces some value \\nor set of values as output.\\n• An algorithm is a sequence of computational \\nsteps that transform the input into the output. \\n• An algorithm is a tool for solving a well-\\nspecified computation problem.\\nOf course, different definitions are favored \\nby different people. Though there is no univer -\\nsally accepted definition, some agreement exists \\nthat an algorithm needs to be correct, finite (in \\nother words, terminate eventually or one must be \\nable to write it in a finite number of steps), and \\nunambiguous. \\n7.2.\\u2008Attributes\\u2008of\\u2008Algorithms\\nThe attributes of algorithms are many and often \\ninclude modularity, correctness, maintainabil -\\nity, functionality, robustness, user-friendliness \\n(i.e. easy to be understood by people), program -\\nmer time, simplicity, and extensibility. A com -\\nmonly emphasized attribute is “performance” \\nor “efficiency” by which we mean both time \\nand resource-usage efficiency while generally \\nemphasizing the time axis. To some degree, effi -\\nciency determines if an algorithm is feasible or \\nimpractical. For example, an algorithm that takes \\none hundred years to terminate is virtually use -\\nless and is even considered incorrect.\\n7.3.\\u2008Algorithmic\\u2008Analysis\\nAnalysis\\u2008of\\u2008algorithms is the theoretical study \\nof computer-program performance and resource \\nusage; to some extent it determines the goodness \\nof an algorithm. Such analysis usually abstracts \\naway the particular details of a specific computer \\nand focuses on the asymptotic, machine-indepen-\\ndent analysis. \\nThere are three basic types of analysis. In \\nworst-case\\u2008analysis, one determines the maxi -\\nmum time or resources required by the algorithm \\non any input of size n. In average-case\\u2008analysis, \\none determines the expected time or resources \\nrequired by the algorithm over all inputs of size \\nn; in performing average-case analysis, one often \\nneeds to make assumptions on the statistical dis -\\ntribution of inputs. The third type of analysis is \\nthe best-case\\u2008analysis, in which one determines \\nthe minimum time or resources required by the \\nalgorithm on any input of size n. Among the \\nthree types of analysis, average-case analysis is \\nthe most relevant but also the most difficult to \\nperform.\\nBesides the basic analysis methods, there are \\nalso the amortized\\u2008analysis, in which one deter -\\nmines the maximum time required by an algo -\\nrithm over a sequence of operations; and the \\ncompetitive\\u2008analysis, in which one determines \\nthe relative performance merit of an algorithm \\nagainst the optimal algorithm (which may not \\nbe known) in the same category (for the same \\noperations).')),\n",

The brute\\u2008force\\u2008strategy is actually a \\nno-strategy. It exhaustively tries every possible \\nway to tackle a problem. If a problem has a solu-\\ntion, this strategy is guaranteed to find it; however, \\nthe time expense may be too high. The divide\\u2008and\\u2008\\nconquer strategy\\u2008improves on the brute force \\nstrategy by dividing a big problem into smaller, \\nhomogeneous problems. It solves the big prob -\\nlem by recursively solving the smaller problems \\nand combing the solutions to the smaller prob -\\nlems to form the solution to the big problem. The \\nunderlying assumption for divide and conquer is \\nthat smaller problems are easier to solve.\\nThe dynamic\\u2008programming\\u2008strategy improves \\non the divide and conquer strategy by recogniz -\\ning that some of the sub-problems produced by \\ndivision may be the same and thus avoids solving \\nthe same problems again and again. This elimina-\\ntion of redundant subproblems can dramatically \\nimprove efficiency. \\nThe greedy\\u2008selection\\u2008strategy further improves \\non dynamic programming by recognizing that \\nnot all of the sub-problems contribute to the solu-\\ntion of the big problem. By eliminating all but \\none sub-problem, the greedy selection strategy \\nachieves the highest efficiency among all algo -\\nrithm design strategies. Sometimes the use of \\nrandomization can improve on the greedy selec -\\ntion strategy by eliminating the complexity in \\ndetermining the greedy choice through coin flip -\\nping or randomization. \\n7.5.\\u2008Algorithmic\\u2008Analysis\\u2008Strategies\\nThe analysis strategies of algorithms include \\nbasic\\u2008counting\\u2008analysis, in which one actually \\ncounts the number of steps an algorithm takes to \\ncomplete its task; asymptotic\\u2008analysis, in which \\none only considers the order of magnitude of \\nthe number of steps an algorithm takes to com -\\nplete its task; probabilistic\\u2008analysis, in which \\none makes use of probabilities in analyzing the \\naverage performance of an algorithm; amor-\\ntized\\u2008analysis, in which one uses the methods of \\naggregation, potential, and accounting to ana -\\nlyze the worst performance of an algorithm on a \\nsequence of operations; and competitive\\u2008analysis, \\nin which one uses methods such as potential and \\naccounting to analyze the relative performance of \\nan algorithm to the optimal algorithm.\\nFor complex problems and algorithms, one \\nmay need to use a combination of the aforemen -\\ntioned analysis strategies.\\n8. Basic Concept of a System\\n[6*, c10]\\nIan Sommerville writes, “a system is a purposeful \\ncollection of interrelated components that work \\ntogether to achieve some objective” [6*].

The life cycle stages of systems \\nengineering vary depending on the system being \\nbuilt but, in general, include system requirements \\ndefinition, system design, sub-system develop -\\nment, system integration, system testing, sys -\\ntem installation, system evolution, and system \\ndecommissioning. \\nMany practical guidelines have been produced \\nin the past to aid people in performing the activi-\\nties of each phase. For example, system design \\ncan be broken into smaller tasks of identification \\nof subsystems, assignment of system require -\\nments to subsystems, specification of subsystem \\nfunctionality, definition of sub-system interfaces, \\nand so forth. \\n8.3.\\u2008Overview\\u2008of\\u2008a\\u2008Computer\\u2008System\\nAmong all the systems, one that is obviously rel-\\nevant to the software engineering community is \\nthe computer system. A computer is a machine \\nthat executes programs or software. It consists of \\na purposeful collection of mechanical, electrical, \\nand electronic components with each component \\nperforming a preset function. Jointly, these com -\\nponents are able to execute the instructions that \\nare given by the program. \\nAbstractly speaking, a computer receives some \\ninput, stores and manipulates some data, and \\nprovides some output. The most distinct feature \\nof a computer is its ability to store and execute \\nsequences of instructions called programs. An \\ninteresting phenomenon concerning the computer \\nis the universal equivalence in functionality. \\nAccording to Turing, all computers with a certain \\nminimum capability are equivalent in their abil -\\nity to perform computation tasks. In other words, \\ngiven enough time and memory, all computers—\\nranging from a netbook to a supercomputer—are \\ncapable of computing exactly the same things, \\nirrespective of speed, size, cost, or anything else.\\nMost computer systems have a structure that \\nis known as the “von Neumann model,” which \\nconsists of five components: a memory for storing \\ninstructions and data, a central\\u2008processing\\u2008unit\\u2008\\nfor performing arithmetic and logical operations, \\na control\\u2008unit for sequencing and interpreting \\ninstructions, input for getting external informa -\\ntion into the memory, and output for producing \\nresults for the user.

Computer Organization\\n[8*, c1–c4]\\nFrom the perspective of a computer, a wide \\nsemantic gap exists between its intended behav -\\nior and the workings of the underlying electronic \\ndevices that actually do the work within the com-\\nputer. This gap is bridged through computer orga-\\nnization, which meshes various electrical, elec -\\ntronic, and mechanical devices into one device \\nthat forms a computer. The objects that computer \\norganization deals with are the devices, connec -\\ntions, and controls. The abstraction built in com -\\nputer organization is the computer.\\n9.1.\\u2008Computer\\u2008Organization\\u2008Overview\\nA computer generally consists of a CPU, mem -\\nory, input devices, and output devices. Abstractly \\nspeaking, the organization of a computer can be \\ndivided into four levels (Figure 13.4). The macro\\u2008\\narchitecture level is the formal specification of all \\nthe functions a particular machine can carry out \\nand is known as the instruction set architecture \\n(ISA). The micro\\u2008architecture level is the imple-\\nmentation of the ISA in a specific CPU—in other \\nwords, the way in which the ISA’s specifications \\nare actually carried out. The logic\\u2008circuits level \\nis the level where each functional component \\nof the micro architecture is built up of circuits \\nthat make decisions based on simple rules. The \\ndevices\\u2008level is the level where, finally, each logic \\ncircuit is actually built of electronic devices such \\nas complementary metal-oxide semiconductors \\n(CMOS), n-channel metal oxide semiconductors \\n(NMOS), or gallium arsenide (GaAs) transistors, \\nand so forth.\\nMacro Architecture Level (ISA)\\nMicro Architecture Level\\nLogic Circuits Level\\nDevices Level\\nFigure 13.4. Machine Architecture Levels\\nEach level provides an abstraction to the level \\nabove and is dependent on the level below. To a \\nprogrammer, the most important abstraction is \\nthe ISA, which specifies such things as the native \\ndata types, instructions, registers, addressing \\nmodes, the memory architecture, interrupt and \\nexception handling, and the I/Os. Overall, the \\nISA specifies the ability of a computer and what \\ncan be done on the computer with programming.\\n9.2.\\u2008Digital\\u2008Systems\\nAt the lowest level, computations are carried out \\nby the electrical and electronic devices within a \\ncomputer. The computer uses circuits and mem -\\nory to hold charges that represents the presence \\nor absence of voltage. The presence of voltage \\nis equal to a 1 while the absence of voltage is a \\nzero. On disk the polarity of the voltage is repre -\\nsented by 0s and 1s that in turn represents the data \\nstored. Everything—including instruction and \\ndata—is expressed or encoded using digital zeros \\nand ones. In this sense, a computer becomes a \\ndigital system. For example, decimal value 6 can \\nbe encoded as 110, the addition instruction may \\nbe encoded as 0001, and so forth. The component \\nof the computer such as the control unit, ALU, \\nmemory and I/O use the information to compute \\nthe instructions.\\n9.3.\\u2008Digital\\u2008Logic\\nObviously, logics are needed to manipulate data \\nand to control the operation of computers. This \\nlogic, which is behind a computer’s proper func -\\ntion, is called digital\\u2008logic because it deals with \\nthe operations of digital zeros and ones. Digital \\nlogic specifies the rules both for building various \\ndigital devices from the simplest elements (such \\nas transistors) and for governing the operation of \\ndigital devices. For example, digital logic spells \\nout what the value will be if a zero and one is \\nANDed, ORed, or exclusively ORed together. It \\nalso specifies how to build decoders, multiplex -\\ners (MUX), memory, and adders that are used to \\nassemble the computer.\\n9.4.\\u2008Computer\\u2008Expression\\u2008of\\u2008Data\\nAs mentioned before, a computer expresses data \\nwith electrical signals or digital zeros and ones. \\nSince there are only two different digits used in ')),\n",

Due to the inherent nature of \\na binary system, the maximum numerical value \\nexpressible by an n-bits binary code is 2 n − 1. \\nSpecifically, binary number anan−1…a1a0 corre -\\nsponds to an × 2n + an−1 × 2n−1 + … + a1 × 21 + \\na0 × 20. Thus, the numerical value of the binary \\nexpression of 1011 is  1 × 8 + 0 × 4 + 1 × 2 + 1 \\n× 1 = 11. To express a nonnumerical value, we \\nneed to decide the number of zeros and ones to \\nuse and the order in which those zeros and ones \\nare arranged.\\nOf course, there are different ways to do the \\nencoding, and this gives rise to different data \\nexpression schemes and subschemes. For example, \\nintegers can be expressed in the form of unsigned, \\none’s complement, or two’s complement. For \\ncharacters, there are ASCII, Unicode, and IBM’s \\nEBCDIC standards. For floating point numbers, \\nthere are IEEE-754 FP 1, 2, and 3 standards. \\n9.5.\\u2008The\\u2008Central\\u2008Processing\\u2008Unit\\u2008(CPU)\\nThe central processing unit is the place where \\ninstructions (or programs) are actually executed. \\nThe execution usually takes several steps, includ-\\ning fetching the program instruction, decoding \\nthe instruction, fetching operands, performing \\narithmetic and logical operations on the oper -\\nands, and storing the result. The main compo -\\nnents of a CPU consist of registers where instruc-\\ntions and data are often read from and written to, \\nthe arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) that performs \\nthe actual arithmetic (such as addition, subtrac -\\ntion, multiplication, and division) and logic (such \\nas AND, OR, shift, and so forth) operations, the \\ncontrol unit that is responsible for producing \\nproper signals to control the operations, and vari-\\nous (data, address, and control) buses that link the \\ncomponents together and transport data to and \\nfrom these components.\\n9.6.\\u2008Memory\\u2008System\\u2008Organization\\nMemory is the storage unit of a computer. It con-\\ncerns the assembling of a large-scale memory \\nsystem from smaller and single-digit storage \\nunits. The main topics covered by memory sys -\\ntem architecture include the following:\\n• Memory cells and chips\\n• Memory boards and modules\\n• Memory hierarchy and cache\\n• Memory as a subsystem of the computer.\\nMemory\\u2008cells\\u2008and\\u2008chips deal with single-digital \\nstorage and the assembling of single-digit units \\ninto one-dimensional memory arrays as well \\nas the assembling of one-dimensional storage \\narrays into multi-dimensional storage memory \\nchips. Memory\\u2008boards\\u2008and\\u2008modules concern the \\nassembling of memory chips into memory sys -\\ntems, with the focus being on the organization, \\noperation, and management of the individual \\nchips in the system. Memory\\u2008hierarchy\\u2008and\\u2008cache \\nare used to support efficient memory operations. \\nMemory\\u2008as\\u2008a\\u2008sub-system deals with the interface \\nbetween the memory system and other parts of \\nthe computer. \\n9.7.\\u2008Input\\u2008and\\u2008Output\\u2008(I/O)\\nA computer is useless without I/O. Common \\ninput devices include the keyboard and mouse; \\ncommon output devices include the disk, the \\nscreen, the printer, and speakers. Different I/O \\ndevices operate at different data rates and reli -\\nabilities. How computers connect and manage \\nvarious input and output devices to facilitate the \\ninteraction between computers and humans (or \\nother computers) is the focus of topics in I/O. \\nThe main issues that must be resolved in input \\nand output are the ways I/O can and should be \\nperformed. \\nIn general, I/O is performed at both hard -\\nware and software levels. Hardware I/O can be \\nperformed in any of three ways. Dedicated\\u2008I/O \\ndedicates the CPU to the actual input and output \\noperations during I/O;\\u2008memory-mapped\\u2008I/O treats \\nI/O operations as memory operations; and hybrid\\u2008\\nI/O combines dedicated I/O and memory-mapped \\nI/O into a single holistic I/O operation mode. \\nCoincidentally, software I/O can also be per -\\nformed in one of three ways. Programmed\\u2008I/O \\nlets the CPU wait while the I/O device is doing \\nI/O; interrupt-driven\\u2008I/O lets the CPU’s handling \\nof I/O be driven by the I/O device; and direct\\u2008\\nmemory\\u2008access (DMA) lets I/O be handled by a \\nsecondary CPU embedded in a DMA device (or ')),\n",

(Except during the initial setup, the \\nmain CPU is not disturbed during a DMA I/O \\noperation.) \\nRegardless of the types of I/O scheme being \\nused, the main issues involved in I/O include I/O\\u2008\\naddressing (which deals with the issue of how to \\nidentify the I/O device for a specific I/O opera -\\ntion), synchronization (which deals with the issue \\nof how to make the CPU and I/O device work \\nin harmony during I/O), and error\\u2008detection\\u2008and\\u2008\\ncorrection (which deals with the occurrence of \\ntransmission errors).\\n10. Compiler Basics\\n[4*, s6.4] [8*, s8.4]\\n10.1.\\u2008Compiler/Interpreter\\u2008Overview\\nProgrammers usually write programs in high \\nlevel language code, which the CPU cannot exe -\\ncute; so this source code has to be converted into \\nmachine code to be understood by a computer. \\nDue to the differences between different ISAs, \\nthe translation must be done for each ISA or spe-\\ncific machine language under consideration. \\nThe translation is usually performed by a piece \\nof software called a compiler or an interpreter . \\nThis process of translation from a high-level lan-\\nguage to a machine language is called compila -\\ntion, or, sometimes, interpretation. \\n10.2.\\u2008Interpretation\\u2008and\\u2008Compilation\\nThere are two ways to translate a program writ -\\nten in a higher-level language into machine code: \\ninterpretation and compilation. Interpretation\\u2008\\ntranslates the source code one statement at a time \\ninto machine language, executes it on the spot, \\nand then goes back for another statement. Both \\nthe high-level-language source code and the inter-\\npreter are required every time the program is run. \\nCompilation translates the high-level-language \\nsource code into an entire machine-language pro-\\ngram (an executable image) by a program called a \\ncompiler. After compilation, only the executable \\nimage is needed to run the program. Most appli -\\ncation software is sold in this form.\\nWhile both compilation and interpretation con-\\nvert high level language code into machine code, \\nthere are some important differences between the \\ntwo methods. First, a compiler makes the conver-\\nsion just once, while an interpreter typically con-\\nverts it every time a program is executed. Second, \\ninterpreting code is slower than running the com-\\npiled code, because the interpreter must analyze \\neach statement in the program when it is executed \\nand then perform the desired action, whereas the \\ncompiled code just performs the action within \\na fixed context determined by the compilation. \\nThird, access to variables is also slower in an \\ninterpreter because the mapping of identifiers to \\nstorage locations must be done repeatedly at run-\\ntime rather than at compile time.\\nThe primary tasks of a compiler may include \\npreprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic \\nanalysis, code generation, and code optimiza -\\ntion. Program faults caused by incorrect compiler \\nbehavior can be very difficult to track down. For \\nthis reason, compiler implementers invest a lot of \\ntime ensuring the correctness of their software.\\n10.3.\\u2008The\\u2008Compilation\\u2008Process\\nCompilation is a complex task. Most compilers \\ndivide the compilation process into many phases. \\nA typical breakdown is as follows:\\n• Lexical Analysis\\n• Syntax Analysis or Parsing\\n• Semantic Analysis\\n• Code Generation\\nLexical\\u2008analysis partitions the input text (the \\nsource code), which is a sequence of characters, \\ninto separate comments, which are to be ignored \\nin subsequent actions, and basic\\u2008symbols,\\u2008which\\u2008\\nhave\\u2008 lexical\\u2008 meanings.\\u2008 These basic symbols \\nmust correspond to some terminal symbols of \\nthe grammar of the particular programming lan -\\nguage. Here terminal symbols refer to the ele -\\nmentary symbols (or tokens) in the grammar that \\ncannot be changed.\\nSyntax\\u2008analysis is based on the results of the \\nlexical analysis and discovers the structure in the \\nprogram and determines whether or not a text \\nconforms to an expected format. Is\\u2008this\\u2008a\\u2008textu-\\nally\\u2008correct\\u2008C++\\u2008program? or Is\\u2008this\\u2008entry\\u2008tex-\\ntually\\u2008correct? are typical questions that can be ')),\n",

Syntax analysis \\ndetermines if the source code of a program is cor-\\nrect and converts it into a more structured rep -\\nresentation (parse tree) for semantic analysis or \\ntransformation.\\nSemantic\\u2008analysis adds semantic information \\nto the parse tree built during the syntax analysis \\nand builds the symbol table. It performs vari -\\nous semantic checks that include type checking, \\nobject binding (associating variable and function \\nreferences with their definitions), and definite \\nassignment (requiring all local variables to be \\ninitialized before use). If mistakes are found, the \\nsemantically incorrect program statements are \\nrejected and flagged as errors.\\nOnce semantic analysis is complete, the phase \\nof code\\u2008generation begins and transforms the \\nintermediate code produced in the previous \\nphases into the native machine language of the \\ncomputer under consideration. This involves \\nresource and storage decisions—such as deciding \\nwhich variables to fit into registers and memory \\nand the selection and scheduling of appropriate \\nmachine instructions, along with their associated \\naddressing modes.\\nIt is often possible to combine multiple phases \\ninto one pass over the code in a compiler imple -\\nmentation. Some compilers also have a prepro -\\ncessing phase at the beginning or after the lexical \\nanalysis that does necessary housekeeping work, \\nsuch as processing the program instructions for \\nthe compiler (directives). Some compilers pro -\\nvide an optional optimization phase at the end of \\nthe entire compilation to optimize the code (such \\nas the rearrangement of instruction sequence) \\nfor efficiency and other desirable objectives \\nrequested by the users.\\n11. Operating Systems Basics\\n[4*, c3]\\nEvery system of meaningful complexity needs \\nto be managed. A computer, as a rather complex \\nelectrical-mechanical system, needs its own man-\\nager for managing the resources and activities \\noccurring on it. That manager is called an operat-\\ning\\u2008system\\u2008(OS).\\n11.1. Operating\\u2008Systems\\u2008Overview\\nOperating systems is a collection of software and \\nfirmware, that controls the execution of computer \\nprograms and provides such services as computer \\nresource allocation, job control, input/output con-\\ntrol, and file management in a computer system. \\nConceptually, an operating system is a computer \\nprogram that manages the hardware resources \\nand makes it easier to use by applications by pre-\\nsenting nice abstractions. This nice abstraction \\nis often called the virtual machine and includes \\nsuch things as processes, virtual memory, and \\nfile systems. An OS hides the complexity of the \\nunderlying hardware and is found on all modern \\ncomputers.\\nThe principal roles played by OSs are manage-\\nment and illusion. Management refers to the OS’s \\nmanagement (allocation and recovery) of physi -\\ncal resources among multiple competing users/\\napplications/tasks. Illusion refers to the nice \\nabstractions the OS provides. \\n11.2. Tasks\\u2008of\\u2008an\\u2008Operating\\u2008System\\nThe tasks of an operating system differ signifi -\\ncantly depending on the machine and time of its \\ninvention. However, modern operating systems \\nhave come to agreement as to the tasks that must \\nbe performed by an OS. These tasks include CPU \\nmanagement, memory management, disk man -\\nagement (file system), I/O device management, \\nand security and protection. Each OS task man -\\nages one type of physical resource.\\nSpecifically, CPU management deals with the \\nallocation and releases of the CPU among com -\\npeting programs (called processes/threads in OS \\njargon), including the operating system itself. The \\nmain abstraction provided by CPU management is \\nthe process/thread model. Memory management \\ndeals with the allocation and release of memory \\nspace among competing processes, and the main \\nabstraction provided by memory management \\nis virtual memory. Disk management deals with \\nthe sharing of magnetic or optical or solid state \\ndisks among multiple programs/users and its main \\nabstraction is the file system. I/O device manage-\\nment deals with the allocation and releases of \\nvarious I/O devices among competing processes. ')),\n",

Operating\\u2008System\\u2008Abstractions\\nThe arsenal of OSs is abstraction. Corresponding \\nto the five physical tasks, OSs use five abstrac -\\ntions: process/thread, virtual memory, file sys -\\ntems, input/output, and protection domains. The \\noverall OS abstraction is the virtual machine.\\nFor each task area of OS, there is both a physi-\\ncal reality and a conceptual abstraction. The phys-\\nical reality refers to the hardware resource under \\nmanagement; the conceptual abstraction refers \\nto the interface the OS presents to the users/pro -\\ngrams above. For example, in the thread model \\nof the OS, the physical reality is the CPU and the \\nabstraction is multiple CPUs. Thus, a user doesn’t \\nhave to worry about sharing the CPU with others \\nwhen working on the abstraction provided by an \\nOS. In the virtual memory abstraction of an OS, \\nthe physical reality is the physical RAM or ROM \\n(whatever), the abstraction is multiple unlim -\\nited memory space. Thus, a user doesn’t have to \\nworry about sharing physical memory with others \\nor about limited physical memory size.\\nAbstractions may be virtual or transparent; \\nin this context virtual applies to something that \\nappears to be there, but isn’t (like usable memory \\nbeyond physical), whereas transparent applies \\nto something that is there, but appears not to be \\nthere (like fetching memory contents from disk or \\nphysical memory).\\n11.4. Operating\\u2008Systems\\u2008Classification\\nDifferent operating systems can have different \\nfunctionality implementation. In the early days \\nof the computer era, operating systems were rela-\\ntively simple. As time goes on, the complexity \\nand sophistication of operating systems increases \\nsignificantly. From a historical perspective, an \\noperating system can be classified as one of the \\nfollowing.\\n• Batching\\u2008OS:\\u2008organizes and processes work \\nin batches. Examples of such OSs include \\nIBM’s FMS, IBSYS, and University of \\nMichigan’s UMES. \\n• Multiprogrammed\\u2008batching\\u2008OS: adds mul -\\ntitask capability into earlier simple batching \\nOSs. An example of such an OS is IBM’s \\nOS/360.\\n• Time-sharing\\u2008OS:\\u2008adds multi-task and inter-\\nactive capabilities into the OS. Examples of \\nsuch OSs include UNIX, Linux, and NT.\\n• Real-time\\u2008 OS: adds timing predictabil -\\nity into the OS by scheduling individual \\ntasks according to each task’s completion \\ndeadlines. Examples of such OS include \\nVxWorks (WindRiver) and DART (EMC).\\n• Distributed\\u2008OS: adds the capability of man -\\naging a network of computers into the OS.\\n• Embedded\\u2008OS: has limited functionality and \\nis used for embedded systems such as cars \\nand PDAs. Examples of such OSs include \\nPalm OS, Windows CE, and TOPPER.\\nAlternatively, an OS can be classified by its \\napplicable target machine/environment into the \\nfollowing.\\n• Mainframe\\u2008OS: runs on the mainframe com-\\nputers and include OS/360, OS/390, AS/400, \\nMVS, and VM.\\n• Server\\u2008OS: runs on workstations or servers \\nand includes such systems as UNIX, Win -\\ndows, Linux, and VMS.\\n• Multicomputer\\u2008OS: runs on multiple com -\\nputers and include such examples as Novell \\nNetware.\\n• Personal\\u2008computers\\u2008OS: runs on personal \\ncomputers and include such examples as \\nDOS, Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.\\n• Mobile\\u2008device\\u2008OS: runs on personal devices \\nsuch as cell phones, IPAD and include such \\nexamples of iOS, Android, Symbian, etc.\\n12. Database Basics and Data Management\\n[4*, c9]\\nA database consists of an organized collection of \\ndata for one or more uses.

The \\nfactors considered in database design include per-\\nformance, concurrency, integrity, and recovery \\nfrom hardware failures.\\n12.1. Entity\\u2008and\\u2008Schema\\nThe things a database tries to model and store are \\ncalled entities. Entities can be real-world objects \\nsuch as persons, cars, houses, and so forth, or they \\nmay be abstract concepts such as persons, salary, \\nnames, and so forth. An entity can be primitive \\nsuch as a name or composite such as an employee \\nthat consists of a name, identification number, \\nsalary, address, and so forth. \\nThe single most important concept in a database \\nis the schema, which is a description of the entire \\ndatabase structure from which all other database \\nactivities are built. A schema defines the relation-\\nships between the various entities that compose a \\ndatabase. For example, a schema for a company \\npayroll system would consist of such things as \\nemployee ID, name, salary rate, address, and so \\nforth. Database software maintains the database \\naccording to the schema.\\nAnother important concept in database is the \\ndatabase\\u2008model that describes the type of rela -\\ntionship among various entities. The commonly \\nused models include relational, network, and \\nobject models. \\n12.2. Database\\u2008Management\\u2008Systems\\u2008(DBMS)\\nDatabase Management System (DBMS) compo -\\nnents include database applications for the stor -\\nage of structured and unstructured data and the \\nrequired database management functions needed \\nto view, collect, store, and retrieve data from the \\ndatabases. A DBMS controls the creation, main -\\ntenance, and use of the database and is usually \\ncategorized according to the database model it \\nsupports—such as the relational, network, or \\nobject model. For example, a relational database \\nmanagement system (RDBMS) implements fea -\\ntures of the relational model. An object database \\nmanagement system (ODBMS) implements fea -\\ntures of the object model. \\n12.3. Database\\u2008Query\\u2008Language\\nUsers/applications interact with a database \\nthrough a database query language, which is a spe-\\ncialized programming language tailored to data -\\nbase use. The database model tends to determine \\nthe query languages that are available to access \\nthe database. One commonly used query lan -\\nguage for the relational database is the structured \\nquery language, more commonly abbreviated as \\nSQL. A common query language for object data-\\nbases is the object query language (abbreviated as \\nOQL). There are three components of SQL: Data \\nDefinition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation \\nLanguage (DML), and Data Control Language \\n(DCL). An example of an DML query may look \\nlike the following:\\nSELECT Component_No, Quantity\\nFROM COMPONENT\\nWHERE Item_No = 100\\nThe above query selects all the Component_No \\nand its corresponding quantity from a database \\ntable called COMPONENT, where the Item_No \\nequals to 100.\\n12.4.

End users can selec -\\ntively retrieve and display information and \\nproduce printed reports. This is the operation \\nthat most users know about databases.\\n• Database\\u2008Maintenance is used to add, delete, \\nupdate, and correct the data in a database.\\n• Application\\u2008Development\\u2008is used to develop \\nprototypes of data entry screens, queries, \\nforms, reports, tables, and labels for a proto-\\ntyped application.

In a relational \\nmodel, data are organized as tables with different \\ntables representing different entities or relations \\namong a set of entities. The storage of data deals \\nwith the storage of these database tables on disks. \\nThe common ways for achieving this is to use files. \\nSequential, indexed, and hash files are all used in \\nthis purpose with different file structures providing \\ndifferent access performance and convenience.\\n12.6.

To take full advantage of a database, one \\ncan perform statistical analysis and pattern dis -\\ncovery on the content of a database using a tech -\\nnique called data\\u2008mining.

A network \\nfacilitates the communications between all the \\nconnected computers and may give the illusion \\nof a single, omnipresent computer. Every com -\\nputer or device connected to a network is called \\na network\\u2008node.\\nA number of computing paradigms have emerged \\nto benefit from the functions and capabilities \\nprovided by computer networks. These paradigms \\ninclude distributed computing, grid computing, \\nInternet computing, and cloud computing.\\n13.1.

All these components are called nodes \\nin the jargon of networking. Each component per-\\nforms a distinctive function that is essential for \\nthe packaging, connection, transmission, amplifi-\\ncation, controlling, unpacking, and interpretation \\nof the data. For example, a repeater amplifies the \\nsignals, a switch performs many-to-many connec-\\ntions, a hub performs one-to-many connections, \\nan interface card is attached to the computer and \\nperforms data packing and transmission, a bridge \\nconnects one network with another, and a router is \\na computer itself and performs data analysis and \\nflow control to regulate the data from the network. \\nThe functions performed by various network \\ncomponents correspond to the functions specified \\nby one or more levels of the seven-layer Open \\nSystems Interconnect (OSI) networking model, \\nwhich is discussed below.\\n13.3. Networking\\u2008Protocols\\u2008and\\u2008Standards\\nComputers communicate with each other using \\nprotocols, which specify the format and regula -\\ntions used to pack and un-pack data. To facilitate \\neasier communication and better structure, net -\\nwork protocols are divided into different layers \\nwith each layer dealing with one aspect of the \\ncommunication. For example, the physical lay -\\ners deal with the physical connection between \\nthe parties that are to communicate, the data link \\nlayer deals with the raw data transmission and \\nflow control, and the network layer deals with the \\npacking and un-packing of data into a particular \\nformat that is understandable by the relevant par-\\nties. The most commonly used OSI networking \\nmodel organizes network protocols into seven \\nlayers, as depicted in Figure 13.5.\\nOne thing to note is that not all network proto-\\ncols implement all layers of the OSI model. For \\nexample, the TCP/IP protocol implements neither \\nthe presentation layer nor the session layer. \\nThere can be more than one protocol for each \\nlayer. For example, UDP and TCP both work on \\nthe transport layer above IP’s network layer, pro-\\nviding best-effort, unreliable transport (UDP) vs. \\nreliable transport function (TCP). Physical layer \\nprotocols include token ring, Ethernet, fast Ether-\\nnet, gigabit Ethernet, and wireless Ethernet. Data \\nlink layer protocols include frame-relay, asyn -\\nchronous transfer mode (ATM), and Point-to-\\nPoint Protocol (PPP). Application layer protocols \\ninclude Fibre channel, Small Computer System \\nInterface (SCSI), and Bluetooth. For each layer \\nor even each individual protocol, there may be \\nstandards established by national or international \\norganizations to guide the design and develop -\\nment of the corresponding protocols.\\nApplication Layer\\nPresentation Layer\\nSession Layer\\nTransport Layer\\nNetwork Layer \\nData link Layer \\nPhysical Layer \\nFigure 13.5.

Virtual\\u2008Private\\u2008Network\\u2008(VPN)\\u2008\\nA virtual private network is a preplanned virtual \\nconnection between nodes in a LAN/WAN or on \\nthe internet. It allows the network administrator \\nto separate network traffic into user groups that \\nhave a common affinity for each other such as \\nall users in the same organization, or workgroup. \\nThis circuit type may improve performance \\nand security between nodes and allows for eas -\\nier maintenance of circuits when troubleshooting. \\n14. Parallel and Distributed Computing\\n[8*, c9]\\nParallel computing is a computing paradigm that \\nemerges with the development of multi-func -\\ntional units within a computer. The main objec -\\ntive of parallel computing is to execute several \\ntasks simultaneously on different functional units \\nand thus improve throughput or response or both. \\nDistributed computing, on the other hand, is a \\ncomputing paradigm that emerges with the devel-\\nopment of computer networks. Its main objective \\nis to either make use of multiple computers in the \\nnetwork to accomplish things otherwise not pos -\\nsible within a single computer or improve com -\\nputation efficiency by harnessing the power of \\nmultiple computers.\\n14.1. Parallel\\u2008and\\u2008Distributed\\u2008Computing\\u2008\\nOverview\\nTraditionally, parallel computing investigates \\nways to maximize concurrency (the simultaneous \\nexecution of multiple tasks) within the bound -\\nary of a computer. Distributed computing studies \\ndistributed systems, which consists of multiple \\nautonomous computers that communicate through \\na computer network. Alternatively, distributed \\ncomputing can also refer to the use of distributed \\nsystems to solve computational or transactional \\nproblems. In the former definition, distributed \\ncomputing investigates the protocols, mecha -\\nnisms, and strategies that provide the foundation \\nfor distributed computation; in the latter definition, \\ndistributed computing studies the ways of dividing \\na problem into many tasks and assigning such tasks \\nto various computers involved in the computation.\\nFundamentally, distributed computing is \\nanother form of parallel computing, albeit on a \\ngrander scale. In distributed computing, the func-\\ntional units are not ALU, FPU, or separate cores, \\nbut individual computers. For this reason, some \\npeople regard distributed computing as being the \\nsame as parallel computing. Because both distrib-\\nuted and parallel computing involve some form \\nof concurrency, they are both also called concur-\\nrent computing. \\n14.2. Difference\\u2008between\\u2008Parallel\\u2008and\\u2008Distrib-\\nuted\\u2008Computing\\nThough parallel and distributed computing resem-\\nble each other on the surface, there is a subtle but \\nreal distinction between them: parallel comput -\\ning does not necessarily refer to the execution of \\nprograms on different computers— instead, they \\ncan be run on different processors within a single \\ncomputer. In fact, consensus among computing \\nprofessionals limits the scope of parallel comput-\\ning to the case where a shared memory is used by \\nall processors involved in the computing, while \\ndistributed computing refers to computations \\nwhere private memory exists for each processor \\ninvolved in the computations. \\nAnother subtle difference between parallel and \\ndistributed computing is that parallel computing \\nnecessitates concurrent execution of several tasks \\nwhile distributed computing does not have this \\nnecessity. \\nBased on the above discussion, it is possible \\nto classify concurrent systems as being “parallel” \\nor “distributed” based on the existence or nonex-\\nistence of shared memory among all the proces -\\nsor: parallel computing deals with computations \\nwithin a single computer; distributed computing \\ndeals with computations within a set of comput -\\ners. According to this view, multicore computing \\nis a form of parallel computing.\\n14.3. Parallel\\u2008and\\u2008Distributed\\u2008Computing\\u2008\\nModels\\nSince multiple computers/processors/cores are \\ninvolved in distributed/parallel computing, some \\ncoordination among the involved parties is nec -\\nessary to ensure correct behavior of the system.

The most common mod -\\nels in this regard are the shared memory (paral -\\nlel) model and the message-passing (distributed) \\nmodel. \\nIn a shared\\u2008memory\\u2008(parallel)\\u2008model, all com-\\nputers have access to a shared central memory \\nwhere local caches are used to speed up the \\nprocessing power. These caches use a protocol \\nto insure the localized data is fresh and up to \\ndate, typically the MESI protocol. The algorithm \\ndesigner chooses the program for execution by \\neach computer. Access to the central memory can \\nbe synchronous or asynchronous, and must be \\ncoordinated such that coherency is maintained. \\nDifferent access models have been invented for \\nsuch a purpose.\\nIn a message-passing\\u2008(distributed)\\u2008model, all \\ncomputers run some programs that collectively \\nachieve some purpose. The system must work \\ncorrectly regardless of the structure of the net -\\nwork. This model can be further classified into \\nclient-server (C/S), browser-server (B/S), and \\nn-tier models. In the C/S model, the server pro -\\nvides services and the client requests services \\nfrom the server. In the B/S model, the server pro-\\nvides services and the client is the browser. In the \\nn-tier model, each tier (i.e. layer) provides ser -\\nvices to the tier immediately above it and requests \\nservices from the tier immediately below it. In \\nfact, the n-tier model can be seen as a chain of \\nclient-server models. Often, the tiers between the \\nbottommost tier and the topmost tier are called \\nmiddleware, which is a distinct subject of study \\nin its own right. \\n14.4. Main\\u2008Issues\\u2008in\\u2008Distributed\\u2008Computing\\nCoordination among all the components in a dis-\\ntributed computing environment is often complex \\nand time-consuming. As the number of cores/\\nCPUs/computers increases, the complexity of \\ndistributed computing also increases. Among \\nthe many issues faced, memory coherency and \\nconsensus among all computers are the most dif-\\nficult ones. Many computation paradigms have \\nbeen invented to solve these problems and are \\nthe main discussion issues in distributed/parallel \\ncomputing.\\n15. Basic User Human Factors\\n[3*, c8] [9*, c5]\\nSoftware is developed to meet human desires or \\nneeds. Thus, all software design and develop -\\nment must take into consideration human-user \\nfactors such as how people use software, how \\npeople view software, and what humans expect \\nfrom software. There are numerous factors in the \\nhuman-machine interaction, and ISO 9241 docu-\\nment series define all the detailed standards of \\nsuch interactions.[10] But the basic human-user \\nfactors considered here include input/output, the \\nhandling of error messages, and the robustness of \\nthe software in general.\\n15.1. Input\\u2008and\\u2008Output\\nInput and output are the interfaces between users \\nand software. Software is useless without input \\nand output. Humans design software to process \\nsome input and produce desirable output. All \\nsoftware engineers must consider input and out -\\nput as an integral part of the software product \\nthey engineer or develop. Issues considered for \\ninput include (but are not limited to):\\n• What input is required?\\n• How is the input passed from users to \\ncomputers?\\n• What is the most convenient way for users to \\nenter input?\\n• What format does the computer require of \\nthe input data?\\nThe designer should request the minimum \\ndata from human input, only when the data is not \\nalready stored in the system. The designer should \\nformat and edit the data at the time of entry to \\nreduce errors arising from incorrect or malicious \\ndata entry. \\nFor output, we need to consider what the users \\nwish to see: \\n• In what format would users like to see \\noutput?\\n• What is the most pleasing way to display \\noutput?')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 245}, page_content='Computing Foundations 13-23\\nIf the party interacting with the software isn’t \\nhuman but another software or computer or con -\\ntrol system, then we need to consider the input/\\noutput type and format that the software should \\nproduce to ensure proper data exchange between \\nsystems.\\nThere are many rules of thumb for developers \\nto follow to produce good input/output for a soft-\\nware. These rules of thumb include simple and \\nnatural dialogue, speaking users’ language, mini-\\nmizing user memory load, consistency, minimal \\nsurprise, conformance to standards (whether \\nagreed to or not: e.g., automobiles have a stan -\\ndard interface for accelerator, brake, steering). \\n15.2. Error\\u2008Messages\\nIt is understandable that most software con -\\ntains faults and fails from time to time. But \\nusers should be notified if there is anything that \\nimpedes the smooth execution of the program. \\nNothing is more frustrating than an unexpected \\ntermination or behavioral deviation of software \\nwithout any warning or explanation. To be user \\nfriendly, the software should report all error con-\\nditions to the users or upper-level applications \\nso that some measure can be taken to rectify the \\nsituation or to exit gracefully. There are several \\nguidelines that define what constitutes a good \\nerror message: error messages should be clear, to \\nthe point, and timely.\\nFirst, error messages should clearly explain \\nwhat is happening so that users know what is \\ngoing on in the software. Second, error mes -\\nsages should pinpoint the cause of the error, if at \\nall possible, so that proper actions can be taken. \\nThird, error messages should be displayed right \\nwhen the error condition occurs. According to \\nJakob Nielsen, “Good error messages should be \\nexpressed in plain language (no codes), precisely \\nindicate the problem, and constructively suggest \\na solution” [9*]. Fourth, error messages should \\nnot overload the users with too much informa -\\ntion and cause them to ignore the messages all \\ntogether.\\nHowever, messages relating to security access \\nerrors should not provide extra information that \\nwould help unauthorized persons break in.\\n15.3. Software\\u2008Robustness\\nSoftware robustness refers to the ability of soft -\\nware to tolerate erroneous inputs. Software is said \\nto be robust if it continues to function even when \\nerroneous inputs are given. Thus, it is unaccept -\\nable for software to simply crash when encoun -\\ntering an input problem as this may cause unex -\\npected consequences, such as the loss of valuable \\ndata. Software that exhibits such behavior is con-\\nsidered to lack robustness. \\nNielsen gives a simpler description of software \\nrobustness: “The software should have a low \\nerror rate, so that users make few errors during \\nthe use of the system and so that if they do make \\nerrors they can easily recover from them. Further, \\ncatastrophic errors must not occur” [9*]. \\nThere are many ways to evaluate the robust -\\nness of software and just as many ways to make \\nsoftware more robust. For example, to improve \\nrobustness, one should always check the validity \\nof the inputs and return values before progress -\\ning further; one should always throw an excep -\\ntion when something unexpected occurs, and \\none should never quit a program without first \\ngiving users/applications a chance to correct the \\ncondition.\\n16. Basic Developer Human Factors\\n[3*, c31–32]\\nDeveloper human factors refer to the consider -\\nations of human factors taken when developing \\nsoftware. Software is developed by humans, read \\nby humans, and maintained by humans. If any -\\nthing is wrong, humans are responsible for cor -\\nrecting those wrongs. Thus, it is essential to write \\nsoftware in a way that is easily understandable \\nby humans or, at the very least, by other software \\ndevelopers. A program that is easy to read and \\nunderstand exhibits readability.\\nThe means to ensure that software meet this \\nobjective are numerous and range from proper \\narchitecture at the macro level to the particular \\ncoding style and variable usage at the micro level. \\nBut the two prominent factors are structure (or \\nprogram layouts) and comments\\u2008(documentation).

       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 246}, page_content='13-24 SWEBOK® Guide V3.0\\n16.1. Structure\\u2008\\nWell-structured programs are easier to understand \\nand modify. If a program is poorly structured, then \\nno amount of explanation or comments is sufficient \\nto make it understandable. The ways to organize a \\nprogram are numerous and range from the proper \\nuse of white space, indentation, and parentheses to \\nnice arrangements of groupings, blank lines, and \\nbraces. Whatever style one chooses, it should be \\nconsistent across the entire program.\\n16.2. Comments\\nTo most people, programming is coding. These \\npeople do not realize that programming also \\nincludes writing comments and that comments are \\nan integral part of programming. True, comments \\nare not used by the computer and certainly do not \\nconstitute final instructions for the computer, but \\nthey improve the readability of the programs by \\nexplaining the meaning and logic of the statements \\nor sections of code. It should be remembered that \\nprograms are not only meant for computers, they \\nare also read, written, and modified by humans.\\nThe types of comments include repeat of the \\ncode, explanation of the code, marker of the \\ncode, summary of the code, description of the \\ncode’s intent, and information that cannot possi -\\nbly be expressed by the code itself. Some com -\\nments are good, some are not. The good ones \\nare those that explain the intent of the code and \\njustify why this code looks the way it does. The \\nbad ones are repeat of the code and stating irrel -\\nevant information. The best comments are self-\\ndocumenting code. If the code is written in such a \\nclear and precise manner that its meaning is self-\\nproclaimed, then no comment is needed. But this \\nis easier said than done. Most programs are not \\nself-explanatory and are often hard to read and \\nunderstand if no comments are given. \\nHere are some general guidelines for writing \\ngood comments:\\n• Comments should be consistent across the \\nentire program.\\n• Each function should be associated with \\ncomments that explain the purpose of the \\nfunction and its role in the overall program.\\n• Within a function, comments should be \\ngiven for each logical section of coding to \\nexplain the meaning and purpose (intention) \\nof the section. \\n• Comments should stipulate what freedom \\ndoes (or does not) the maintaining program -\\nmers have with respect to making changes to \\nthat code.\\n• Comments are seldom required for indi -\\nvidual statements. If a statement needs com-\\nments, one should reconsider the statement. \\n17. Secure Software Development and \\nMaintenance\\n[11*, c29]\\nDue to increasing malicious activities targeted \\nat computer systems, security has become a sig -\\nnificant issue in the development of software. In \\naddition to the usual correctness and reliability, \\nsoftware developers must also pay attention to \\nthe security of the software they develop. Secure \\nsoftware development builds security in software \\nby following a set of established and/or recom -\\nmended rules and practices in software develop -\\nment. Secure software maintenance complements \\nsecure software development by ensuring the no \\nsecurity problems are introduced during software \\nmaintenance. \\nA generally accepted view concerning software \\nsecurity is that it is much better to design security \\ninto software than to patch it in after software is \\ndeveloped. To design security into software, one \\nmust take into consideration every stage of the soft-\\nware development lifecycle. In particular, secure \\nsoftware development involves software require-\\nments\\u2008security, software design\\u2008security, software \\nconstruction\\u2008security,\\u2008and software testing\\u2008secu-\\nrity. In addition, security must also be taken into \\nconsideration when performing software mainte-\\nnance as security faults and loopholes can be and \\noften are introduced during maintenance. \\n17.1.\\u2008Software\\u2008Requirements\\u2008Security\\nSoftware requirements security deals with the \\nclarification and specification of security policy \\nand objectives into software requirements, which ')),\n",

Factors to consider \\nin this phase include software requirements and \\nthreats/risks. The former refers to the specific \\nfunctions that are required for the sake of secu -\\nrity; the latter refers to the possible ways that the \\nsecurity of software is threatened. \\n17.2.\\u2008Software\\u2008Design\\u2008Security\\nSoftware Design security deals with the design \\nof software modules that fit together to meet \\nthe security objectives specified in the security \\nrequirements. This step clarifies the details of \\nsecurity considerations and develops the specific \\nsteps for implementation. Factors considered \\nmay include frameworks and access modes that \\nset up the overall security monitoring/enforce -\\nment strategies, as well as the individual policy \\nenforcement mechanisms.\\n17.3.\\u2008Software\\u2008Construction\\u2008Security\\nSoftware construction security concerns the ques-\\ntion of how to write actual programming code for \\nspecific situations such that security considerations \\nare taken care of. The term “Software Construction \\nSecurity” could mean different things for different \\npeople. It can mean the way a specific function is \\ncoded, such that the coding itself is secure, or it can \\nmean the coding of security into software.\\nMost people entangle the two together without \\ndistinction. One reason for such entanglement is \\nthat it is not clear how one can make sure that a \\nspecific coding is secure. For example, in C pro -\\ngramming language, the expression of i<<1 (shift \\nthe binary representation of i’s value to the left by \\none bit) and 2*i (multiply the value of variable i \\nby constant 2) mean the same thing semantically, \\nbut do they have the same security ramification? \\nThe answer could be different for different com -\\nbinations of ISAs and compilers. Due to this lack \\nof understanding, software construction secu -\\nrity—in its current state of existence—mostly \\nrefers to the second aspect mentioned above: the \\ncoding of security into software.\\nCoding of security into software can be \\nachieved by following recommended rules. A few \\nsuch rules follow: \\n• Structure the process so that all sections \\nrequiring extra privileges are modules. The \\nmodules should be as small as possible and \\nshould perform only those tasks that require \\nthose privileges.\\n• Ensure that any assumptions in the program \\nare validated. If this is not possible, docu -\\nment them for the installers and maintainers \\nso they know the assumptions that attackers \\nwill try to invalidate.\\n• Ensure that the program does not share \\nobjects in memory with any other program.\\n• The error status of every function must be \\nchecked. Do not try to recover unless neither \\nthe cause of the error nor its effects affect \\nany security considerations. The program \\nshould restore the state of the software to \\nthe state it had before the process began, and \\nthen terminate.\\n17.4.\\u2008Software\\u2008Testing\\u2008Security\\nSoftware testing security  determines that soft -\\nware protects data and maintains security speci -\\nfication as given.

One trend that emerges in this regard \\nis the Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) con-\\ncept, which is a classical spiral model that takes \\na holistic view of security from the perspective \\nof software lifecycle and ensures that security is \\ninherent in software design and development, not \\nan afterthought later in production.

In a \\nvery simple language, one can program only for \\nsomething that follows a well-understood, non -\\nambiguous logic. The Mathematical Foundations \\nknowledge area (KA) helps software engineers \\ncomprehend this logic, which in turn is translated \\ninto programming language code. The mathemat-\\nics that is the primary focus in this KA is quite \\ndifferent from typical arithmetic, where numbers \\nare dealt with and discussed. Logic and reason -\\ning are the essence of mathematics that a software \\nengineer must address. \\nMathematics, in a sense, is the study of formal \\nsystems. The word “formal” is associated with \\npreciseness, so there cannot be any ambiguous or \\nerroneous interpretation of the fact. Mathemat -\\nics is therefore the study of any and all certain \\ntruths about any concept. This concept can be \\nabout numbers as well as about symbols, images, \\nsounds, video—almost anything. In short, not \\nonly numbers and numeric equations are sub -\\nject to preciseness. On the contrary, a software \\nengineer needs to have a precise abstraction on a \\ndiverse application domain. \\nThe SWEBOK Guide’s Mathematical Founda-\\ntions KA covers basic techniques to identify a set \\nof rules for reasoning in the context of the system \\nunder study. Anything that one can deduce fol -\\nlowing these rules is an absolute certainty within \\nthe context of that system. In this KA, techniques \\nthat can represent and take forward the reasoning \\nand judgment of a software engineer in a precise \\n(and therefore mathematical) manner are defined \\nand discussed. The language and methods of logic \\nthat are discussed here allow us to describe math-\\nematical proofs to infer conclusively the absolute \\ntruth of certain concepts beyond the numbers. In \\nshort, you can write a program for a problem only \\nif it follows some logic. The objective of this KA \\nis to help you develop the skill to identify and \\ndescribe such logic. The emphasis is on helping \\nyou understand the basic concepts rather than on \\nchallenging your arithmetic abilities.\\nBREAKDOWN OF TOPICS FOR \\nMATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS\\nThe breakdown of topics for the Mathematical \\nFoundations KA is shown in Figure 14.1. \\n1. Set, Relations, Functions\\n[1*, c2]\\nSet. A set is a collection of objects, called elements \\nof the set. A set can be represented by listing its \\nelements between braces, e.g., S = {1, 2, 3}. \\nThe symbol ∈ is used to express that an ele -\\nment belongs to a set, or—in other words—is a \\nmember of the set. Its negation is represented by \\n∉, e.g., 1 ∈ S, but 4 ∉ S.\\nIn a more compact representation of set using \\nset builder notation, {x | P(x)} is the set of all x \\nsuch that P(x) for any proposition P(x) over any \\nuniverse of discourse. Examples for some impor-\\ntant sets include the following:\\nN = {0, 1, 2, 3, …} = the set of nonnegative \\nintegers.\\nZ = {…, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …} = the set of \\nintegers.\\nFinite\\u2008and\\u2008Infinite\\u2008Set. A set with a finite num-\\nber of elements is called a finite set. Conversely, \\nany set that does not have a finite number of ele -\\nments in it is an infinite\\u2008set. The set of all natural \\nnumbers, for example, is an infinite set. ')),\n",

The cardinality of a finite set S is \\nthe number of elements in S. This is represented \\n|S|, e.g., if S = {1, 2, 3}, then |S| = 3.\\nUniversal\\u2008Set. In general S = {x ∈ U | p(x)}, \\nwhere U is the universe of discourse in which \\nthe predicate P(x) must be interpreted. The “uni -\\nverse of discourse” for a given predicate is often \\nreferred to as the universal set. Alternately, one \\nmay define universal set as the set of all elements.\\nSet\\u2008Equality. Two sets are equal if and only if \\nthey have the same elements, i.e.:\\nX = Y ≡ ∀p (p ∈ X ↔ p ∈ Y).\\nSubset. X is a subset of set Y , or X is contained \\nin Y , if all elements of X are included in Y . This is \\ndenoted by X ⊆ Y . In other words, X ⊆ Y if and \\nonly if ∀p (p ∈ X → p ∈ Y). \\nFor example, if X = {1, 2, 3} and Y = {1, 2, 3, \\n4, 5}, then X ⊆ Y.\\nIf X is not a subset of Y , it is denoted as X \\n Y.\\nProper\\u2008Subset. X is a proper subset of Y (denoted \\nby X ⊂ Y) if X is a subset of Y but not equal to Y , \\ni.e., there is some element in Y that is not in X.\\nIn other words, X ⊂ Y if (X ⊆ Y) ∧ (X ≠ Y).\\nFor example, if X = {1, 2, 3}, Y = {1, 2, 3, \\n4}, and Z = {1, 2, 3}, then X ⊂ Y , but X is not a \\nproper subset of Z. Sets X and Z are equal sets.\\nIf X is not a proper subset of Y , it is denoted \\nas X ⊄ Y.\\nSuperset. If X is a subset of Y , then Y is called \\na superset of X. This is denoted by Y ⊇ X, i.e., Y \\n⊇ X if and only if X ⊆ Y.\\nFor example, if X = {1, 2, 3} and Y = {1, 2, 3, \\n4, 5}, then Y ⊇ X.\\nEmpty\\u2008Set. A set with no elements is called an \\nempty\\u2008set. An empty set, denoted by ∅, is also \\nreferred to as a null or void set.\\nPower\\u2008Set. The set of all subsets of a set X is \\ncalled the power\\u2008set of X. It is represented as \\n℘(X). \\nFor example, if X = {a, b, c}, then ℘(X) = {∅, \\n{a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}. If \\n|X| = n, then |℘(X)| = 2n.\\nVenn\\u2008Diagrams. Venn diagrams are graphic rep-\\nresentations of sets as enclosed areas in the plane.\\nFor example, in Figure 14.2, the rectangle rep-\\nresents the universal set and the shaded region \\nrepresents a set X.\\nFigure 14.2. Venn Diagram for Set X\\n1.1. Set\\u2008Operations\\nIntersection. The intersection of two sets X and \\nY, denoted by X ∩ Y, is the set of common ele -\\nments in both X and Y.\\nIn other words, X ∩ Y = {p | (p ∈ X) ∧ (p ∈ Y)}.\\nAs, for example, {1, 2, 3} ∩ {3, 4, 6} = {3}\\nIf X ∩ Y = f, then the two sets X and Y are said \\nto be a disjoint pair of sets.\\nFigure 14.1.

Venn Diagram for X − Y\\nCartesian\\u2008Product. An ordinary pair {p, q} is \\na set with two elements. In a set, the order of the \\nelements is irrelevant, so {p, q} = {q, p}. \\nIn an ordered pair (p, q), the order of occur -\\nrences of the elements is relevant. Thus, (p, q) ≠ \\n(q, p) unless p = q.

De Morgan’s Laws:\\n(X ∪ Y)' = X' ∩ Y' (X ∩ Y)' = X' ∪ Y'\\n1.3. Relation\\u2008and\\u2008Function\\nA relation is an association between two sets of \\ninformation. For example, let’s consider a set \\nof residents of a city and their phone numbers. \\nThe pairing of names with corresponding phone \\nnumbers is a relation. This pairing is ordered\\u2008for \\nthe entire relation. In the example being consid -\\nered, for each pair, either the name comes first \\nfollowed by the phone number or the reverse. \\nThe set from which the first element is drawn is \\ncalled the domain\\u2008set and the other set is called \\nthe range\\u2008set. The domain is what you start with \\nand the range is what you end up with. \\nA function is a well-behaved relation. A rela -\\ntion R(X, Y) is well behaved if the function maps \\nevery element of the domain set X to a single ele-\\nment of the range set Y . Let’s consider domain set \\nX as a set of persons and let range set Y store their \\nphone numbers. Assuming that a person may have \\nmore than one phone number, the relation being \\nconsidered is not a function. However, if we draw \\na relation between names of residents and their \\ndate of births with the name set as domain, then \\nthis becomes a well-behaved relation and hence a \\nfunction. This means that, while all functions are \\nrelations, not all relations are functions. In case \\nof a function given an x, one gets one and exactly \\none y for each ordered pair (x, y).\\nFor example, let’s consider the following two \\nrelations.\\nA: {(3, –9), (5, 8), (7, –6), (3, 9), (6, 3)}.\\nB: {(5, 8), (7, 8), (3, 8), (6, 8)}.\\nAre these functions as well?\\nIn case of relation A, the domain is all the \\nx-values, i.e., {3, 5, 6, 7}, and the range is all the \\ny-values, i.e., {–9, –6, 3, 8, 9}.\\nRelation A is not a function, as there are two \\ndifferent range values, –9 and 9, for the same \\nx-value of 3.\\nIn case of relation B, the domain is same as that \\nfor A, i.e., {3, 5, 6, 7}. However, the range is a \\nsingle element {8}. This qualifies as an example \\nof a function even if all the x-values are mapped \\nto the same y-value. Here, each x-value is distinct \\nand hence the function is well behaved. Relation \\nB may be represented by the equation y = 8.\\nThe characteristic of a function may be verified \\nusing a vertical line test, which is stated below:\\nGiven\\u2008the\\u2008graph\\u2008of\\u2008a\\u2008relation,\\u2008if\\u2008one\\u2008can\\u2008draw\\u2008\\na\\u2008vertical\\u2008line\\u2008that\\u2008crosses\\u2008the\\u2008graph\\u2008in\\u2008more\\u2008than\\u2008\\none\\u2008place,\\u2008then\\u2008the\\u2008relation\\u2008is\\u2008not\\u2008a\\u2008function.\\u2008\\nFigure 14.7. Vertical Line Test for Function\\nIn this example, both lines L1 and L2 cut the \\ngraph for the relation thrice. This signifies that \\nfor the same x-value, there are three different \\ny-values for each of case. Thus, the relation is not \\na function.\")),\n",

Predicate\\u2008Logic\\u2008\\nA predicate is a verb phrase template that \\ndescribes a property of objects or a relationship \\namong objects represented by the variables. For \\nexample, in the sentence, The\\u2008flower\\u2008is\\u2008red, the \\ntemplate is\\u2008red is a predicate. It describes the \\nproperty of a flower. The same predicate may be \\nused in other sentences too. \\nPredicates are often given a name, e.g., “Red” \\nor simply “R” can be used to represent the predi-\\ncate is\\u2008red. Assuming R as the name for the predi-\\ncate is\\u2008red, sentences that assert an object is of the \\ncolor red can be represented as R(x), where x rep-\\nresents an arbitrary object. R(x) reads as x\\u2008is\\u2008red. \\nQuantifiers allow statements about entire col -\\nlections of objects rather than having to enumer -\\nate the objects by name.\\nThe Universal quantifier ∀x asserts that a sen -\\ntence is true for all values of variable x.\\nFor example, ∀x Tiger(x) → Mammal(x) \\nmeans all tigers are mammals.\\nThe Existential quantifier ∃x asserts that a sen-\\ntence is true for at least one value of variable x.\\nFor example, ∃x Tiger(x) → Man-eater(x) means \\nthere exists at least one tiger that is a man-eater.\\nThus, while universal quantification uses \\nimplication, the existential quantification natu -\\nrally uses conjunction.')),\n",

The expres-\\nsion implies that cats exist and everything is \\nblack. \\nPropositional logic falls short in representing \\nmany assertions that are used in computer sci -\\nence and mathematics. It also fails to compare \\nequivalence and some other types of relationship \\nbetween propositions.\\nFor example, the assertion a\\u2008is\\u2008greater\\u2008than\\u2008\\n1 is not a proposition because one cannot infer \\nwhether it is true or false without knowing the \\nvalue of a. Thus, propositional logic cannot deal \\nwith such sentences. However, such assertions \\nappear quite often in mathematics and we want \\nto infer on those assertions. Also, the pattern \\ninvolved in the following two logical equiva -\\nlences cannot be captured by propositional \\nlogic: “Not\\u2008all\\u2008men\\u2008are\\u2008smokers” and “Some\\u2008men\\u2008\\ndon’t\\u2008smoke.” Each of these two propositions \\nis treated independently in propositional logic. \\nThere is no mechanism in propositional logic to \\nfind out whether or not the two are equivalent to \\none another. Hence, in propositional logic, each \\nequivalent proposition is treated individually \\nrather than dealing with a general formula that \\ncovers all equivalences collectively. \\nPredicate logic is supposed to be a more pow -\\nerful logic that addresses these issues. In a sense, \\npredicate logic (also known as first-order logic \\nor predicate calculus) is an extension of propo -\\nsitional logic to formulas involving terms and \\npredicates.\\n3. Proof Techniques\\n[1*, c1]\\nA proof is an argument that rigorously establishes  \\nthe truth of a statement. Proofs can themselves be \\nrepresented formally as discrete structures.\\nStatements used in a proof include axioms \\nand postulates that are essentially the underlying \\nassumptions about mathematical structures, the \\nhypotheses of the theorem to be proved, and pre-\\nviously proved theorems.\\nA theorem is a statement that can be shown to \\nbe true.\\nA lemma is a simple theorem used in the proof \\nof other theorems.\\nA corollary is a proposition that can be estab -\\nlished directly from a theorem that has been \\nproved.\\nA conjecture is a statement whose truth value \\nis unknown.\\nWhen a conjecture’s proof is found, the conjec-\\nture becomes a theorem. Many times conjectures \\nare shown to be false and, hence, are not theorems.\\n3.1. Methods\\u2008of\\u2008Proving\\u2008Theorems\\nDirect\\u2008Proof. Direct proof is a technique to estab-\\nlish that the implication p → q is true by showing \\nthat q must be true when p is true.\\nFor example, to show that if n is odd then n2−1 \\nis even, suppose n is odd, i.e., n = 2k + 1 for some \\ninteger k: \\n∴ n2 = (2k + 1)2 = 4k2 + 4k + 1.\\nAs the first two terms of the Right Hand Side \\n(RHS) are even numbers irrespective of the value \\nof k, the Left Hand Side (LHS) (i.e., n2) is an odd \\nnumber. Therefore, n2−1 is even.\\nProof\\u2008by\\u2008Contradiction. A proposition p is true \\nby contradiction if proved based on the truth of \\nthe implication ¬ p → q where q is a contradiction.\\nFor example, to show that the sum of 2x + 1 \\nand 2y − 1 is even, assume that the sum of 2x + 1 \\nand 2y − 1is odd. In other words, 2(x + y), which \\nis a multiple of 2, is odd. This is a contradiction. \\nHence, the sum of 2x + 1 and 2y − 1 is even. \\nAn inference rule is a pattern establishing that \\nif a set of premises are all true, then it can be \\ndeduced that a certain conclusion statement is \\ntrue. The reference rules of addition, simplifica -\\ntion, and conjunction need to be studied.\\nProof\\u2008by\\u2008Induction. Proof by induction is done \\nin two phases.

In the second phase, it is estab-\\nlished that if the proposition holds for an arbitrary \\npositive integer k, then it must also hold for the \\nnext greater integer, k\\u2008+\\u20081. In other words, proof \\nby induction is based on the rule of inference that \\ntells us that the truth of an infinite sequence of \\npropositions P(n), ∀n ∈ [1 … ∞] is established \\nif P(1) is true, and secondly, ∀k ∈ [2 ... n] if P(k) \\n→ P(k + 1). \\nIt may be noted here that, for a proof by math -\\nematical induction, it is not assumed that P(k) is \\ntrue for all positive integers k. Proving a theo -\\nrem or proposition only requires us to establish \\nthat if it is assumed P(k) is true for any arbitrary \\npositive integer k, then P(k + 1) is also true. The \\ncorrectness of mathematical induction as a valid \\nproof technique is beyond discussion of the cur -\\nrent text. Let us prove the following proposition \\nusing induction.\\nProposition: The\\u2008sum\\u2008of\\u2008the\\u2008first\\u2008n\\u2008positive\\u2008odd\\u2008\\nintegers\\u2008P(n)\\u2008is\\u2008n2. \\nBasis Step: The proposition is true for n = 1 as \\nP(1) = 12 = 1. The basis step is complete.\\nInductive Step: The induction hypothesis (IH) \\nis that the proposition is true for n = k, k being an \\narbitrary positive integer k. \\n∴ 1 + 3 + 5+ … + (2k − 1) = k2 \\nNow, it’s to be shown that P(k) → P(k + 1).\\nP(k + 1) = 1 + 3 + 5+ … +(2k − 1) + (2k + 1)\\n = P(k) + (2k + 1)\\n = k2 + (2k + 1) [using IH]\\n = k2 + 2k + 1\\n = (k + 1)2 \\nThus, it is shown that if the proposition is true \\nfor n = k, then it is also true for n = k + 1.\\nThe basis step together with the inductive step of \\nthe proof show that P(1) is true and the conditional \\nstatement P(k) → P(k + 1) is true for all positive \\nintegers k. Hence, the proposition is proved.\\n4.

If A and B are two disjoint events, P(A \\nor B) = P(A) + P(B).

Example of a Tree\\nHowever, one should remember that a tree is \\nstrictly hierarchical in nature as compared to a \\ngraph, which is flat. In case of a tree, an ordered \\npair is built between two nodes as parent and \\nchild. Each child node in a tree is associated \\nwith only one parent node, whereas this restric -\\ntion becomes meaningless for a graph where no \\nparent-child association exists. \\nAn undirected graph is a tree if and only if \\nthere is a unique simple path between any two of \\nits vertices.\\nFigure 14.15 presents a tree T(N, E) where the \\nset of nodes N = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K}. \\nThe edge set E is {(A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (B, E), \\n(B, F), (B, G), (C, H), (C, I), (D, J), (D, K)}.\\nThe parent of a nonroot node v  is the unique \\nnode u with a directed edge from u to v. Each \\nnode in the tree has a unique parent node except \\nthe root of the tree.\\nFor example, in Figure 14.15, root node A is \\nthe parent node for nodes B, C, and D. Similarly, \\nB is the parent of E, F, G, and so on. The root \\nnode A does not have any parent. \\nA node that has children is called an internal  \\nnode.\\nFor example, in Figure 14.15, node A or node B \\nare examples of internal nodes. \\nThe degree of a node in a tree is the same as its \\nnumber of children.\\nFor example, in Figure 14.15, root node A and \\nits child B are both of degree 3. Nodes C and D \\nhave degree 2. \\nThe distance of a node from the root node in \\nterms of number of hops is called its level. Nodes \\nin a tree are at different levels. The root node is \\nat level 0. Alternately, the level of a node X is the \\nlength of the unique path from the root of the tree \\nto node X.\\nFor example, root node A is at level 0 in Fig -\\nure 14.15. Nodes B, C, and D are at level 1. The \\nremaining nodes in Figure 14.15 are all at level 2.\\nThe height of a tree is the maximum of the lev-\\nels of nodes in the tree. \\nFor example, in Figure 14.15, the height of the \\ntree is 2.\\nA node is called a leaf if it has no children. The \\ndegree of a leaf node is 0.\\nFor example, in Figure 14.15, nodes E through \\nK are all leaf nodes with degree 0. \\nThe ancestors or predecessors of a nonroot \\nnode X are all the nodes in the path from root to \\nnode X.\\nFor example, in Figure 14.15, nodes A and D \\nform the set of ancestors for J. \\nThe successors or descendents of a node X are \\nall the nodes that have X as its ancestor. For a tree \\nwith n nodes, all the remaining n − 1 nodes are \\nsuccessors of the root node.\\nFor example, in Figure 14.15, node B has suc -\\ncessors in E, F, and G. \\nIf\\u2008node\\u2008X\\u2008is\\u2008an\\u2008ancestor\\u2008of\\u2008node\\u2008Y,\\u2008then\\u2008node\\u2008Y\\u2008\\nis\\u2008a\\u2008successor\\u2008of\\u2008X.\\nTwo or more nodes sharing the same parent \\nnode are called sibling nodes. \\nFor example, in Figure 14.15, nodes E and G \\nare siblings.

However, one must consider \\nthat besides this criterion in terms of the degree \\nof internal nodes, a binary tree is always ordered. \\nIf the positions of the left and right subtrees for \\nany node in the tree are swapped, then a new tree \\nis derived. \\nFigure 14.16. Examples of Binary Trees\\nFor example, in Figure 14.16, the two binary \\ntrees are different as the positions of occurrences \\nof the children of A are different in the two trees.\\nFigure 14.17. Example of a Full Binary Tree\\nAccording to [1*], a binary tree is called a full \\nbinary tree if every internal node has exactly two \\nchildren.\\nFor example, the binary tree in Figure 14.17 \\nis a full binary tree, as both of the two internal \\nnodes A and B are of degree 2. \\nA full binary tree following the definition \\nabove is also referred to as a strictly\\u2008binary\\u2008tree.\\nFor example, both binary trees in Figure 14.18 \\nare complete binary trees. The tree in Figure \\n14.18(a) is a complete as well as a full binary \\ntree. A complete binary tree has all its levels, \\nexcept possibly the last one, filled up to capacity. \\nIn case the last level of a complete binary tree is \\nnot full, nodes occur from the leftmost positions \\navailable.\\nFigure 14.18. Example of Complete Binary Trees\\nInterestingly, following the definitions above, \\nthe tree in Figure 14.18(b) is a complete but not \\nfull binary tree as node B has only one child in D. \\nOn the contrary, the tree in Figure 14.17 is a full \\n—but not complete—binary tree, as the children \\nof B occur in the tree while the children of C do \\nnot appear in the last level. \\nA binary tree of height H is balanced if all its \\nleaf nodes occur at levels H or H − 1.\\nFor example, all three binary trees in Figures \\n14.17 and 14.18 are balanced binary trees. \\nThere are at most 2 H leaves in a binary tree of \\nheight H. In other words, if a binary tree with L \\nleaves is full and balanced, then its height is H = \\n⎡log2L⎤.\\nFor example, this statement is true for the \\ntwo trees in Figures 14.17 and 14.18(a) as both \\ntrees are full and balanced. However, the expres-\\nsion above does not match for the tree in Figure \\n14.18(b) as it is not a full binary tree. \\nA binary search tree (BST) is a special kind of \\nbinary tree in which each node contains a distinct \\nkey value, and the key value of each node in the \\ntree is less than every key value in its right subtree \\nand greater than every key value in its left subtree.\\nA traversal algorithm is a procedure for sys -\\ntematically visiting every node of a binary tree. \\nTree traversals may be defined recursively.\\nIf T is binary tree with root R and the remain -\\ning nodes form an ordered pair of nonnull left \\nsubtree TL and nonnull right subtree TR below R, \\nthen the preorder traversal function PreOrder(T) \\nis defined as: \\nPreOrder(T) = R, PreOrder(TL), PreOrder(TR)  \\n… eqn. 1')),\n",

Discrete Probability\\n[1*, c7]\\nProbability is the mathematical description of \\nrandomness. Basic definition of probability and \\nrandomness has been defined in section 4 of this \\nKA. Here, let us start with the concepts behind \\nprobability distribution and discrete probability. \\nA probability model is a mathematical descrip-\\ntion of a random phenomenon consisting of two \\nparts: a sample space S and a way of assigning \\nprobabilities to events. The sample space defines \\nthe set of all possible outcomes, whereas an event \\nis a subset of a sample space representing a pos -\\nsible outcome or a set of outcomes.\\nA random variable is a function or rule that \\nassigns a number to each outcome. Basically, it \\nis just a symbol that represents the outcome of an \\nexperiment.\\nFor example, let X be the number of heads \\nwhen the experiment is flipping a coin n times. \\nSimilarly, let S be the speed of a car as registered \\non a radar detector.\\nThe values for a random variable could be dis-\\ncrete or continuous depending on the experiment. \\nA discrete random variable can hold all pos -\\nsible outcomes without missing any, although it \\nmight take an infinite amount of time.\\nA continuous random variable is used to mea -\\nsure an uncountable number of values even if an \\ninfinite amount of time is given.\\nFor example, if a random variable X represents \\nan outcome that is a real number between 1 and \\n100, then X may have an infinite number of val -\\nues. One can never list all possible outcomes for \\nX even if an infinite amount of time is allowed. \\nHere, X is a continuous random variable. On \\nthe contrary, for the same interval of 1 to 100, \\nanother random variable Y can be used to list all \\nthe integer values in the range. Here, Y is a dis -\\ncrete random variable.\\nAn upper-case letter, say X, will represent \\nthe name\\u2008of the random variable. Its lower-case \\ncounterpart, x, will represent the value of the ran-\\ndom variable.\\nThe probability that the random variable X will \\nequal x is: \\nP(X = x) or, more simply, P(x).\\nA probability distribution (density) function is \\na table, formula, or graph that describes the val -\\nues of a random variable and the probability asso-\\nciated with these values.')),\n",

Moreover, \\nthe average value is more likely to be closer to \\nthe expected value of any one experiment as the \\nnumber of experiments increases.\\n7. Finite State Machines\\n[1*, c13]\\nA computer system may be abstracted as a map -\\nping from state to state driven by inputs. In other \\nwords, a system may be considered as a transition \\nfunction T: S × I → S × O, where S is the set of \\nstates and I, O are the input and output functions.\\nIf the state set S is finite (not infinite), the sys -\\ntem is called a finite\\u2008state\\u2008machine (FSM).\\nAlternately, a finite state machine (FSM) is a \\nmathematical abstraction composed of a finite \\nnumber of states and transitions between those \\nstates. If the domain S × I is reasonably small, \\nthen one can specify T explicitly using diagrams \\nsimilar to a flow graph to illustrate the way logic \\nflows for different inputs. However, this is prac -\\ntical only for machines that have a very small \\ninformation capacity.\\nAn FSM has a finite internal memory, an input \\nfeature that reads symbols in a sequence and one \\nat a time, and an output feature. \\nThe operation of an FSM begins from a start \\nstate, goes through transitions depending on input \\nto different states, and can end in any valid state. \\nHowever, only a few of all the states mark a suc-\\ncessful flow of operation. These are called accept\\u2008\\nstates.\\nThe information capacity of an FSM is  \\nC = log |S|. Thus, if we represent a machine having \\nan information capacity of C bits as an FSM, then \\nits state transition graph will have |S| = 2C nodes.\\nA finite state machine is formally defined as M\\u2008\\n= (S, I, O, f, g, s0).\\nS is the state set;\\nI is the set of input symbols;\\nO is the set of output symbols;\\nf is the state transition function;')),\n",

Grammars\\n[1*, c13]\\nThe grammar of a natural language tells us \\nwhether a combination of words makes a valid \\nsentence. Unlike natural languages, a formal lan-\\nguage is specified by a well-defined set of rules for \\nsyntaxes. The valid sentences of a formal language \\ncan be described by a grammar with the help of \\nthese rules, referred to as production\\u2008rules.\\nA formal language is a set of finite-length \\nwords or strings over some finite alphabet, and \\na grammar  specifies the rules for formation of \\nthese words or strings. The entire set of words \\nthat are valid for a grammar constitutes the lan -\\nguage for the grammar. Thus, the grammar G is \\nany compact, precise mathematical definition of a \\nlanguage L as opposed to just a raw listing of all \\nof the language’s legal sentences or examples of \\nthose sentences.\\nA grammar implies an algorithm that would \\ngenerate all legal sentences of the language. \\nThere are different types of grammars. \\nA phrase-structure or Type-0 grammar G = (V , \\nT, S, P) is a 4-tuple in which:\\n• V is the vocabulary, i.e., set of words.\\n• T ⊆ V is a set of words called terminals. \\n• S ∈ N is a special word called the start \\nsymbol.\\n• P is the set of productions rules for substitut-\\ning one sentence fragment for another.\\nThere exists another set N = V − T of words \\ncalled nonterminals. The nonterminals represent \\nconcepts like noun.\\u2008Production rules are applied \\non strings containing nonterminals until no more \\nnonterminal symbols are present in the string. \\nThe start symbol S is a nonterminal.')),\n",

The Chom-\\nsky hierarchy (introduced by Noam Chomsky in \\n1956) describes such a classification scheme. \\nFigure 14.23. Chomsky Hierarchy of Grammars\\nAs illustrated in Figure 14.23, we infer the fol-\\nlowing on different types of grammars:\\n1. Every regular grammar is a context-free \\ngrammar (CFG).\\n2. Every CFG is a context-sensitive grammar \\n(CSG).\\n3. Every CSG is a phrase-structure grammar \\n(PSG).\\nContext-Sensitive Grammar: All fragments in \\nthe RHS are either longer than the corresponding \\nfragments in the LHS or empty, i.e., if b → a, then \\n|b| < |a| or a = ∅.\\nA formal language is context-sensitive if a con-\\ntext-sensitive grammar generates it.\\nContext-Free Grammar: All fragments in the \\nLHS are of length 1, i.e., if A → a, then |A| = 1 \\nfor all A ∈ N.\\nThe term context-free derives from the fact that \\nA can always be replaced by a, regardless of the \\ncontext in which it occurs.\\nA formal language is context-free if a context-\\nfree grammar generates it. Context-free lan -\\nguages are the theoretical basis for the syntax of \\nmost programming languages.\\nRegular\\u2008Grammar. All fragments in the RHS \\nare either single terminals or a pair built by a \\nterminal and a nonterminal; i.e., if A → a, then \\neither a ∈ T, or a = cD, or a = Dc for c ∈ T, D ∈ N.\\nIf a = cD, then the grammar is called a right \\nlinear grammar. On the other hand, if a = Dc, then \\nthe grammar is called a left linear grammar. Both \\nthe right linear and left linear grammars are regu-\\nlar or Type-3 grammar. \\nThe language L(G) generated by a regular \\ngrammar G is called a regular language.\\nA regular expression A is a string (or pattern) \\nformed from the following six pieces of infor -\\nmation: a ∈ S, the set of alphabets, e, 0 and the \\noperations, OR (+), PRODUCT (.), CONCATE -\\nNATION (*).

Numerical Precision, Accuracy, and Errors\\n[2*, c2]\\nThe main goal of numerical analysis is to \\ndevelop efficient algorithms for computing pre -\\ncise numerical values of functions, solutions of \\nalgebraic and differential equations, optimization \\nproblems, etc.\\nA matter of fact is that all digital computers can \\nonly store finite numbers. In other words, there \\nis no way that a computer can represent an infi -\\nnitely large number—be it an integer, rational \\nnumber, or any real or all complex numbers (see \\nsection 10, Number Theory). So the mathematics \\nof approximation becomes very critical to handle \\nall the numbers in the finite range that a computer \\ncan handle.\\nEach number in a computer is assigned a loca -\\ntion or word, consisting of a specified number of \\nbinary digits or bits. A k bit word can store a total \\nof N = 2k different numbers. \\nFor example, a computer that uses 32 bit arith-\\nmetic can store a total of N = 2 32 ≈ 4.3 × 109 dif-\\nferent numbers, while another one that uses 64 \\nbits can handle N’ = 2 64 ≈ 1.84 × 10 19 different \\nnumbers. The question is how to distribute these \\nN numbers over the real line for maximum effi -\\nciency and accuracy in practical computations.\\nOne evident choice is to distribute them evenly, \\nleading to fixed-point arithmetic. In this system, \\nthe first bit in a word is used to represent a sign \\nand the remaining bits are treated for integer val-\\nues. This allows representation of the integers \\nfrom 1 − ½N, i.e., = 1 − 2 k−1 to 1. As an approxi-\\nmating method, this is not good for noninteger \\nnumbers. \\nAnother option is to space the numbers closely \\ntogether—say with a uniform gap of 2−n—and so \\ndistribute the total N numbers uniformly over the \\ninterval −2−n−1N < x ≤ 2−n−1N. Real numbers lying \\nbetween the gaps are represented by either round-\\ning (meaning the closest exact representative) \\nor chopping (meaning the exact representative \\nimmediately below —or above, if negative—the \\nnumber). \\nNumbers lying beyond the range must be repre-\\nsented by the largest (or largest negative) number \\nthat can be represented. This becomes a symbol \\nfor overflow. Overflow occurs when a computa -\\ntion produces a value larger than the maximum \\nvalue in the range.\\nWhen processing speed is a significant bottle -\\nneck, the use of the fixed-point representations \\nis an attractive and faster alternative to the more \\ncumbersome floating-point arithmetic most com-\\nmonly used in practice.\\nLet’s define a couple of very important terms: \\naccuracy and precision as associated with numer-\\nical analysis. \\nAccuracy is the closeness with which a mea -\\nsured or computed value agrees with the true value.\\nPrecision, on the other hand, is the closeness \\nwith which two or more measured or computed \\nvalues for the same physical substance agree with \\neach other. In other words, precision is the close-\\nness with which a number represents an exact \\nvalue.\\nLet x be a real number and let x* be an approxi-\\nmation. The absolute\\u2008error in the approximation \\nx* ≈ x is defined as | x* − x |. The relative\\u2008error \\nis defined as the ratio of the absolute error to the \\nsize of x, i.e., |x* − x| / | x |, which assumes x ¹ 0; \\notherwise, relative error is not defined.\\nFor example, 1000000 is an approximation to \\n1000001 with an absolute error of 1 and a relative \\nerror of 10−6, while 10 is an approximation of 11 \\nwith an absolute error of 1 and a relative error of \\n0.1. Typically, relative error is more intuitive and \\nthe preferred determiner of the size of the error. \\nThe present convention is that errors are always \\n≥ 0, and are = 0 if and only if the approximation \\nis exact. \\nAn approximation x* has k significant deci -\\nmal digits if its relative error is < 5 × 10−k−1. This \\nmeans that the first k digits of x* following its \\nfirst nonzero digit are the same as those of x.\\nSignificant digits are the digits of a number that \\nare known to be correct. In a measurement, one \\nuncertain digit is included.\\nFor example, measurement of length with \\na ruler of 15.5 mm with ±0.5 mm maximum ')),\n",

Of \\ncourse, it concerns questions about numbers, \\nusually meaning whole numbers and fractional or \\nrational numbers. The different types of numbers \\ninclude integer, real number, natural number, \\ncomplex number, rational number, etc.\\n10.1.\\u2008Divisibility\\u2008\\nLet’s start this section with a brief description of \\neach of the above types of numbers, starting with \\nthe natural numbers.\\nNatural\\u2008Numbers. This group of numbers starts \\nat 1 and continues: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. Zero \\nis not in this group. There are no negative or frac-\\ntional numbers in the group of natural numbers. \\nThe common mathematical symbol for the set of \\nall natural numbers is N.\\nWhole\\u2008Numbers. This group has all of the natu-\\nral numbers in it plus the number 0.\\nUnfortunately, not everyone accepts the above \\ndefinitions of natural and whole numbers. There \\nseems to be no general agreement about whether \\nto include 0 in the set of natural numbers. \\nMany mathematicians consider that, in Europe, \\nthe sequence of natural numbers traditionally \\nstarted with 1 (0 was not even considered to be \\na number by the Greeks). In the 19th century, set \\ntheoreticians and other mathematicians started \\nthe convention of including 0 in the set of natural \\nnumbers.\\nIntegers. This group has all the whole numbers \\nin it and their negatives. The common mathemati-\\ncal symbol for the set of all integers is Z, i.e., Z = \\n{…, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …}.\\nRational\\u2008Numbers. These are any numbers that \\ncan be expressed as a ratio of two integers. The \\ncommon symbol for the set of all rational num -\\nbers is Q.\\nRational numbers may be classified into \\nthree types, based on how the decimals act. The \\ndecimals either do not exist, e.g., 15, or, when \\ndecimals do exist, they may terminate, as in 15.6, \\nor they may repeat with a pattern, as in 1.666..., \\n(which is 5/3). \\nIrrational\\u2008Numbers. These are numbers that \\ncannot be expressed as an integer divided by an \\ninteger. These numbers have decimals that never \\nterminate and never repeat with a pattern, e.g., PI \\nor √2.\\nReal\\u2008Numbers. This group is made up of all the \\nrational and irrational numbers. The numbers that \\nare encountered when studying algebra are real \\nnumbers. The common mathematical symbol for \\nthe set of all real numbers is R.\\nImaginary\\u2008Numbers. These are all based on the \\nimaginary number i. This imaginary number is \\nequal to the square root of −1. Any real number \\nmultiple of i is an imaginary number, e.g., i, 5i, \\n3.2i, −2.6i, etc.\\nComplex\\u2008Numbers. A complex number is a \\ncombination of a real number and an imaginary \\nnumber in the form a + bi. The real part is a, and \\nb is called the imaginary part. The common math-\\nematical symbol for the set of all complex num -\\nbers is C.\\nFor example, 2 + 3i, 3−5i, 7.3 + 0i, and 0 + 5i.\\nConsider the last two examples:\\n7.3 + 0 i is the same as the real number 7.3. \\nThus, all real numbers are complex numbers with \\nzero for the imaginary part.\\nSimilarly, 0 + 5 i is just the imaginary number \\n5i. Thus, all imaginary numbers are complex \\nnumbers with zero for the real part.\\nElementary number theory involves divisibility \\namong integers.

An algebraic structure \\nconsists of one or two sets closed under some \\noperations and satisfying a number of axioms, \\nincluding none. \\nFor example, group, monoid, ring, and lattice \\nare examples of algebraic structures. Each of \\nthese is defined in this section. \\n11.1. Group\\nA set S closed under a binary operation • forms a \\ngroup if the binary operation satisfies the follow-\\ning four criteria:\\n• Associative: ∀a, b, c ∈ S, the equation (a • b) \\n• c = a • (b • c) holds.\\n• Identity: There exists an identity element I ∈ \\nS such that for all a ∈ S, I • a = a • I = a.\\n• Inverse: Every element a ∈ S, has an inverse \\na' ∈ S with respect to the binary operation, \\ni.e., a • a' = I; for example, the set of integers \\nZ with respect to the addition operation is a \\ngroup. The identity element of the set is 0 for \\nthe addition operation. ∀x ∈ Z, the inverse \\nof x would be –x, which is also included in Z.\\n• Closure property: ∀a, b ∈ S, the result of the \\noperation a • b ∈ S.\\n• A group that is commutative, i.e., a • b = b • a, \\nis known as a commutative or Abelian group. \\nThe set of natural numbers N (with the opera -\\ntion of addition) is not a group, since there is no \\ninverse for any x > 0 in the set of natural numbers. \\nThus, the third rule (of inverse) for our operation \\nis violated. However, the set of natural number \\nhas some structure.\\nSets with an associative operation (the first \\ncondition above) are called semigroups; if they \\nalso have an identity element (the second condi -\\ntion), then they are called monoids.\\nOur set of natural numbers under addition is \\nthen an example of a monoid, a structure that \\nis not quite a group because it is missing the \\nrequirement that every element have an inverse \\nunder the operation.\\nA monoid is a set S that is closed under a single \\nassociative binary operation • and has an identity \\nelement I ∈ S such that for all a ∈ S, I • a = a • I \\n= a. A monoid must contain at least one element. \\nFor example, the set of natural numbers N \\nforms a commutative monoid under addition with \\nidentity element 0. The same set of natural num -\\nbers N also forms a monoid under multiplication \\nwith identity element 1. The set of positive inte -\\ngers P forms a commutative monoid under multi-\\nplication with identity element 1.\\nIt may be noted that, unlike those in a group, \\nelements of a monoid need not have inverses.

Thus, the ele -\\nments of H, equipped with the group operation on \\nG restricted to H, indeed form a group.\\nGiven any subset S of a group G, the subgroup \\ngenerated by S consists of products of elements \\nof S and their inverses. It is the smallest subgroup \\nof G containing S. \\nFor example, let G be the Abelian group whose \\nelements are G = {0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7} and whose \\ngroup operation is addition modulo 8. This group \\nhas a pair of nontrivial subgroups: J\\u2008= {0, 4} and \\nH\\u2008= {0, 2, 4, 6}, where J is also a subgroup of H. \\nIn group theory, a cyclic group is a group that \\ncan be generated by a single element, in the \\nsense that the group has an element a (called the \\ngenerator of the group) such that, when written \\nmultiplicatively, every element of the group is a \\npower of a.\\nA group G is cyclic if G = {an for any integer n}. \\nSince any group generated by an element in a \\ngroup is a subgroup of that group, showing that \\nthe only subgroup of a group G that contains a is \\nG itself suffices to show that G is cyclic.\\nFor example, the group G = {0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, \\n7}, with respect to addition modulo 8 operation, \\nis cyclic. The subgroups J\\u2008= {0, 4} and H\\u2008= {0, 2, \\n4, 6} are also cyclic.\\n11.2. Rings\\u2008\\nIf we take an Abelian group and define a second \\noperation on it, a new structure is found that is \\ndifferent from just a group. If this second opera -\\ntion is associative and is distributive over the \\nfirst, then we have a ring. \\nA ring is a triple of the form (S, +, •), where (S, \\n+) is an Abelian group, (S, •) is a semigroup, and \\n• is distributive over +; i.e., “ a, b, c ∈ S, the equa-\\ntion a\\u2008• (b + c) = (a • b) + (a • c) holds. Further, if \\n• is commutative, then the ring is said to be com-\\nmutative. If there is an identity element for the • \\noperation, then the ring is said to have an identity.\\nFor example, (Z, +, *), i.e., the set of integers Z, \\nwith the usual addition and multiplication opera -\\ntions, is a ring. As (Z, *) is commutative, this ring \\nis a commutative or Abelian ring. The ring has 1 \\nas its identity element.\\nLet’s note that the second operation may not \\nhave an identity element, nor do we need to find \\nan inverse for every element with respect to this \\nsecond operation. As for what distributive means, \\nintuitively it is what we do in elementary math -\\nematics when performing the following change: a \\n* (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c).\\nA field is a ring for which the elements of the \\nset, excluding 0, form an Abelian group with the \\nsecond operation. \\nA simple example of a field is the field of ratio-\\nnal numbers (R, +, *) with the usual addition \\nand multiplication operations. The numbers of \\nthe format a/b\\u2008∈ R, where a,\\u2008b are integers and \\nb ≠ 0. The additive inverse of such a fraction is \\nsimply −a/b, and the multiplicative inverse is b/a \\nprovided that a ≠ 0.')),\n",

This chapter outlines some of the \\nengineering foundational skills and techniques \\nthat are useful for a software engineer. The focus \\nis on topics that support other KAs while mini -\\nmizing duplication of subjects covered elsewhere \\nin this document. \\nAs the theory and practice of software engi -\\nneering matures, it is increasingly apparent that \\nsoftware engineering is an engineering disci -\\npline that is based on knowledge and skills com -\\nmon to all engineering disciplines. This Engi -\\nneering Foundations knowledge area (KA) is \\nconcerned with the engineering foundations that \\napply to software engineering and other engi -\\nneering disciplines. Topics in this KA include \\nempirical methods and experimental techniques; \\nstatistical analysis; measurement; engineering \\ndesign; modeling, prototyping, and simulation; \\nstandards; and root cause analysis. Application \\nof this knowledge, as appropriate, will allow \\nsoftware engineers to develop and maintain \\nsoftware more efficiently and effectively. Com -\\npleting their engineering work efficiently and \\neffectively is a goal of all engineers in all engi -\\nneering disciplines. \\nBREAKDOWN OF TOPICS FOR \\nENGINEERING FOUNDATIONS\\nThe breakdown of topics for the Engineering \\nFoundations KA is shown in Figure 15.1.\\n1. Empirical Methods and Experimental \\nTechniques \\n[2*, c1]\\nAn engineering method for problem solving \\ninvolves proposing solutions or models of solu -\\ntions and then conducting experiments or tests \\nto study the proposed solutions or models. Thus, \\nengineers must understand how to create an exper-\\niment and then analyze the results of the experi -\\nment in order to evaluate the proposed solution. \\nEmpirical methods and experimental techniques \\nhelp the engineer to describe and understand vari-\\nability in their observations, to identify the sources \\nof variability, and to make decisions.\\nThree different types of empirical studies com-\\nmonly used in engineering efforts are designed \\nexperiments, observational studies, and retro -\\nspective studies. Brief descriptions of the com -\\nmonly used methods are given below.\\n1.1. Designed\\u2008Experiment\\nA designed or controlled experiment is an inves -\\ntigation of a testable hypothesis where one or \\nmore independent variables  are manipulated to \\nmeasure their effect on one or more dependent \\nvariables. A precondition for conducting an \\nexperiment is the existence of a clear hypothesis. \\nIt is important for an engineer to understand how \\nto formulate clear hypotheses. ')),\n",

Each combi -\\nnation of values of the independent variables is \\na treatment. The simplest experiments have just \\ntwo treatments representing two levels of a sin -\\ngle independent variable (e.g., using a tool vs. \\nnot using a tool). More complex experimental \\ndesigns arise when more than two levels, more \\nthan one independent variable, or any dependent \\nvariables are used.\\n1.2. Observational\\u2008Study\\nAn observational or case study  is an empirical \\ninquiry that makes observations of processes \\nor phenomena within a real-life context. While \\nan experiment deliberately ignores context, an \\nobservational or case study includes context as \\npart of the observation. A case study is most use-\\nful when the focus of the study is on how and why \\nquestions, when the behavior of those involved in \\nthe study cannot be manipulated, and when con -\\ntextual conditions are relevant and the boundaries \\nbetween the phenomena and context are not clear.\\n1.3. Retrospective\\u2008Study\\nA retrospective study involves the analysis of his-\\ntorical data. Retrospective studies are also known \\nas historical studies. This type of study uses data \\n(regarding some phenomenon) that has been \\narchived over time. This archived data is then ana-\\nlyzed in an attempt to find a relationship between \\nvariables, to predict future events, or to identify \\ntrends. The quality of the analysis results will \\ndepend on the quality of the information contained \\nin the archived data. Historical data may be incom-\\nplete, inconsistently measured, or incorrect. \\n2. Statistical Analysis \\n[2*, c9s1, c2s1] [3*, c10s3] \\nIn order to carry out their responsibilities, engi -\\nneers must understand how different product \\nand process characteristics vary. Engineers often \\ncome across situations where the relationship \\nbetween different variables needs to be studied. \\nAn important point to note is that most of the \\nstudies are carried out on the basis of samples \\nand so the observed results need to be understood \\nwith respect to the full population. Engineers \\nmust, therefore, develop an adequate understand-\\ning of statistical techniques for collecting reliable \\ndata in terms of sampling and analysis to arrive at \\nresults that can be generalized. These techniques \\nare discussed below.\\n2.1. Unit\\u2008of\\u2008Analysis\\u2008(Sampling\\u2008Units),\\u2008\\nPopulation,\\u2008and\\u2008Sample\\nUnit\\u2008of\\u2008analysis.\\u2008While carrying out any empiri -\\ncal study, observations need to be made on cho -\\nsen units called the units of analysis or sampling \\nunits. The unit of analysis must be identified and \\nmust be appropriate for the analysis. For exam -\\nple, when a software product company wants to \\nfind the perceived usability of a software product, \\nthe user or the software function may be the unit \\nof analysis.\\nPopulation. The set of all respondents or items \\n(possible sampling units) to be studied forms the \\npopulation. As an example, consider the case of \\nstudying the perceived usability of a software \\nproduct. In this case, the set of all possible users \\nforms the population. \\nWhile defining the population, care must be \\nexercised to understand the study and target \\npopulation. There are cases when the popula -\\ntion studied and the population for which the \\nFigure 15.1. Breakdown of Topics for the Engineering Foundations KA')),\n",

A sample is a subset of the population. \\nThe most crucial issue towards the selection of \\na sample is its representativeness, including size. \\nThe samples must be drawn in a manner so as \\nto ensure that the draws are independent, and \\nthe rules of drawing the samples must be pre -\\ndefined so that the probability of selecting a par -\\nticular sampling unit is known beforehand. This \\nmethod of selecting samples is called probability\\u2008\\nsampling. \\nRandom\\u2008variable. In statistical terminology, \\nthe process of making observations or measure -\\nments on the sampling units being studied is \\nreferred to as conducting the experiment. For \\nexample, if the experiment is to toss a coin 10 \\ntimes and then count the number of times the \\ncoin lands on heads, each 10 tosses of the coin \\nis a sampling unit and the number of heads for a \\ngiven sample is the observation or outcome for \\nthe experiment. The outcome of an experiment is \\nobtained in terms of real numbers and defines the \\nrandom variable being studied. Thus, the attribute \\nof the items being measured at the outcome of \\nthe experiment represents the random variable \\nbeing studied; the observation obtained from a \\nparticular sampling unit is a particular realization \\nof the random variable. In the example of the coin \\ntoss, the random variable is the number of heads \\nobserved for each experiment. In statistical stud -\\nies, attempts are made to understand population \\ncharacteristics on the basis of samples.\\nThe set of possible values of a random variable \\nmay be finite or infinite but countable (e.g., the \\nset of all integers or the set of all odd numbers). \\nIn such a case, the random variable is called a dis-\\ncrete\\u2008random\\u2008variable. In other cases, the random \\nvariable under consideration may take values on \\na continuous scale and is called a continuous\\u2008ran-\\ndom\\u2008variable.\\nEvent. A subset of possible values of a random \\nvariable is called an event . Suppose X denotes \\nsome random variable; then, for example, we \\nmay define different events such as X ³ x or X < \\nx and so on.\\nDistribution\\u2008of\\u2008a\\u2008random\\u2008variable. The range \\nand pattern of variation of a random variable is \\ngiven by its distribution. When the distribution \\nof a random variable is known, it is possible to \\ncompute the chance of any event. Some distribu-\\ntions are found to occur commonly and are used \\nto model many random variables occurring in \\npractice in the context of engineering. A few of \\nthe more commonly occurring distributions are \\ngiven below.\\n• Binomial distribution: used to model random \\nvariables that count the number of successes \\nin n trials carried out independently of each \\nother, where each trial results in success or \\nfailure. We make an assumption that the \\nchance of obtaining a success remains con -\\nstant [2*, c3s6].\\n• Poisson distribution: used to model the count \\nof occurrence of some event over time or \\nspace [2*, c3s9].\\n• Normal distribution: used to model continu -\\nous random variables or discrete random \\nvariables by taking a very large number of \\nvalues [2*, c4s6].\\nConcept\\u2008of\\u2008parameters. A statistical distribution \\nis characterized by some parameters. For exam -\\nple, the proportion of success in any given trial \\nis the only parameter characterizing a binomial \\ndistribution. Similarly, the Poisson distribution is \\ncharacterized by a rate of occurrence. A normal \\ndistribution is characterized by two parameters: \\nnamely, its mean and standard deviation.\\nOnce the values of the parameters are known, \\nthe distribution of the random variable is com -\\npletely known and the chance (probability) of \\nany event can be computed. The probabilities \\nfor a discrete random variable can be computed \\nthrough the probability mass function, called \\nthe pmf. The pmf is defined at discrete points \\nand gives the point mass—i.e., the probability \\nthat the random variable will take that particular \\nvalue. Likewise, for a continuous random vari -\\nable, we have the probability density function, \\ncalled the pdf. The pdf is very much like density \\nand needs to be integrated over a range to obtain \\nthe probability that the continuous random vari -\\nable lies between certain values. Thus, if the pdf ')),\n",

The estimates are \\nfunctions of the sample values and are called sta-\\ntistics. For example, the sample mean is a statistic \\nand may be used to estimate the population mean. \\nSimilarly, the rate of occurrence of defects esti -\\nmated from the sample (rate of defects per line of \\ncode) is a statistic and serves as the estimate of \\nthe population rate of rate of defects per line of \\ncode. The statistic used to estimate some popula-\\ntion parameter is often referred to as the estimator \\nof the parameter.\\nA very important point to note is that the results \\nof the estimators themselves are random. If we \\ntake a different sample, we are likely to get a dif-\\nferent estimate of the population parameter. In the \\ntheory of estimation, we need to understand dif -\\nferent properties of estimators—particularly, how \\nmuch the estimates can vary across samples and \\nhow to choose between different alternative ways \\nto obtain the estimates. For example, if we wish \\nto estimate the mean of a population, we might \\nuse as our estimator a sample mean, a sample \\nmedian, a sample mode, or the midrange of the \\nsample. Each of these estimators has different \\nstatistical properties that may impact the standard \\nerror of the estimate.\\nTypes\\u2008of\\u2008estimates [2*, c7s3, c8s1].There are \\ntwo types of estimates: namely, point estimates \\nand interval estimates. When we use the value \\nof a statistic to estimate a population parameter, \\nwe get a point estimate. As the name indicates, a \\npoint estimate gives a point value of the param -\\neter being estimated. \\nAlthough point estimates are often used, they \\nleave room for many questions. For instance, we \\nare not told anything about the possible size of \\nerror or statistical properties of the point esti -\\nmate. Thus, we might need to supplement a point \\nestimate with the sample size as well as the vari -\\nance of the estimate. Alternately, we might use \\nan interval estimate. An interval estimate is a \\nrandom interval with the lower and upper lim -\\nits of the interval being functions of the sample \\nobservations as well as the sample size. The lim-\\nits are computed on the basis of some assump -\\ntions regarding the sampling distribution of the \\npoint estimate on which the limits are based. \\nProperties\\u2008 of\\u2008 estimators. Various statistical \\nproperties of estimators are used to decide about \\nthe appropriateness of an estimator in a given \\nsituation. The most important properties are that \\nan estimator is unbiased, efficient, and consistent \\nwith respect to the population.\\nTests\\u2008of\\u2008hypotheses\\u2008[2*, c9s1].A hypothesis is \\na statement about the possible values of a param-\\neter. For example, suppose it is claimed that a \\nnew method of software development reduces the \\noccurrence of defects. In this case, the hypoth -\\nesis is that the rate of occurrence of defects has \\nreduced. In tests of hypotheses, we decide—on \\nthe basis of sample observations—whether a pro-\\nposed hypothesis should be accepted or rejected.\\nFor testing hypotheses, the null and alternative \\nhypotheses are formed. The null hypothesis is the \\nhypothesis of no change and is denoted as H0. The \\nalternative hypothesis is written as H1. It is impor-\\ntant to note that the alternative hypothesis may be \\none-sided or two-sided. For example, if we have \\nthe null hypothesis that the population mean is not \\nless than some given value, the alternative hypoth-\\nesis would be that it is less than that value and we \\nwould have a one-sided test. However, if we have \\nthe null hypothesis that the population mean is \\nequal to some given value, the alternative hypoth-\\nesis would be that it is not equal and we would \\nhave a two-sided test (because the true value could \\nbe either less than or greater than the given value).\\nIn order to test some hypothesis, we first com -\\npute some statistic. Along with the computation \\nof the statistic, a region is defined such that in \\ncase the computed value of the statistic falls in \\nthat region, the null hypothesis is rejected. This \\nregion is called the critical region (also known as \\nthe confidence interval).  In tests of hypotheses, \\nwe need to accept or reject the null hypothesis \\non the basis of the evidence obtained. We note \\nthat, in general, the alternative hypothesis is the \\nhypothesis of interest. If the computed value of \\nthe statistic does not fall inside the critical region, \\nthen we cannot reject the null hypothesis. This \\nindicates that there is not enough evidence to \\nbelieve that the alternative hypothesis is true.')),\n",

Concepts\\u2008of\\u2008Correlation\\u2008and\\u2008Regression\\u2008\\n[2*, c11s2, c11s8]\\nA major objective of many statistical investiga -\\ntions is to establish relationships that make it pos-\\nsible to predict one or more variables in terms of \\nothers. Although it is desirable to predict a quan-\\ntity exactly in terms of another quantity, it is sel -\\ndom possible and, in many cases, we have to be \\nsatisfied with estimating the average or expected \\nvalues. \\nThe relationship between two variables is stud-\\nied using the methods of correlation and regres -\\nsion. Both these concepts are explained briefly in \\nthe following paragraphs.\\nCorrelation. The strength of linear relation -\\nship between two variables is measured using \\nthe correlation coefficient . While computing the \\ncorrelation coefficient between two variables, we \\nassume that these variables measure two differ -\\nent attributes of the same entity. The correlation  \\ncoefficient takes a value between –1 to +1. The \\nvalues –1 and +1 indicate a situation when the \\nassociation between the variables is perfect—i.e., \\ngiven the value of one variable, the other can be \\nestimated with no error. A positive correlation \\ncoefficient indicates a positive relationship—that \\nis, if one variable increases, so does the other. On \\nthe other hand, when the variables are negatively \\ncorrelated, an increase of one leads to a decrease \\nof the other.\\nIt is important to remember that correlation \\ndoes not imply causation. Thus, if two variables \\nare correlated, we cannot conclude that one \\ncauses the other.\\nRegression. The correlation analysis only \\nmeasures the degree of relationship between \\ntwo variables. The analysis to find the relation -\\nship between two variables is called regression\\u2008\\nanalysis. The strength of the relationship between \\ntwo variables is measured using the coefficient of \\ndetermination. This is a value between 0 and 1. \\nThe closer the coefficient is to 1, the stronger the \\nrelationship between the variables. A value of 1 \\nindicates a perfect relationship.\\n3. Measurement \\n[4*, c3s1, c3s2] [5*, c4s4] [6*, c7s5]\\n [7*, p442–447] \\nKnowing what to measure and which measure -\\nment method to use is critical in engineering \\nendeavors. It is important that everyone involved \\nin an engineering project understand the mea -\\nsurement methods and the measurement results \\nthat will be used. \\nMeasurements can be physical, environmen -\\ntal, economic, operational, or some other sort of \\nmeasurement that is meaningful for the particular \\nproject. This section explores the theory of mea -\\nsurement and how it is fundamental to engineer -\\ning. Measurement starts as a conceptualization \\nthen moves from abstract concepts to definitions \\nof the measurement method to the actual appli -\\ncation of that method to obtain a measurement \\nresult.

Measurement methods \\ndefine activities that allocate a value or a symbol \\nto an attribute of an entity. \\nAttributes must then be defined in terms of \\nthe operations used to identify and measure \\nthem— that is, the measurement methods. In this \\napproach, a measurement method is defined to be \\na precisely specified operation that yields a num-\\nber (called the measurement\\u2008result) when mea -\\nsuring an attribute. It follows that, to be useful, \\nthe measurement method has to be well defined. \\nArbitrariness in the method will reflect itself in \\nambiguity in the measurement results.\\nIn some cases—particularly in the physical \\nworld—the attributes that we wish to measure are \\neasy to grasp; however, in an artificial world like \\nsoftware engineering, defining the attributes may \\nnot be that simple. For example, the attributes of \\nheight, weight, distance, etc. are easily and uni -\\nformly understood (though they may not be very \\neasy to measure in all circumstances), whereas \\nattributes such as software size or complexity \\nrequire clear definitions. \\nOperational\\u2008definitions. The definition of attri -\\nbutes, to start with, is often rather abstract. Such \\ndefinitions do not facilitate measurements. For \\nexample, we may define a circle as a\\u2008line\\u2008forming\\u2008\\na\\u2008closed\\u2008loop\\u2008such\\u2008that\\u2008the\\u2008distance\\u2008between\\u2008any\\u2008\\npoint\\u2008on\\u2008this\\u2008line\\u2008and\\u2008a\\u2008fixed\\u2008interior\\u2008point\\u2008called\\u2008\\nthe\\u2008center\\u2008is\\u2008constant. We may further say that the \\nfixed distance from the center to any point on the \\nclosed loop gives the radius of the circle. It may be \\nnoted that though the concept has been defined, no \\nmeans of measuring the radius has been proposed. \\nThe operational definition specifies the exact steps \\nor method used to carry out a specific measure -\\nment. This can also be called the measurement\\u2008\\nmethod; sometimes a measurement\\u2008procedure may \\nbe required to be even more precise.\\nThe importance of operational definitions \\ncan hardly be overstated. Take the case of the \\napparently simple measurement of height of \\nindividuals. Unless we specify various factors \\nlike the time when the height will be measured \\n(it is known that the height of individuals vary \\nacross various time points of the day), how the \\nvariability due to hair would be taken care of, \\nwhether the measurement will be with or without \\nshoes, what kind of accuracy is expected (correct \\nup to an inch, 1/2 inch, centimeter, etc.)—even \\nthis simple measurement will lead to substantial \\nvariation. Engineers must appreciate the need to \\ndefine measures from an operational perspective.\\n3.1. Levels\\u2008(Scales)\\u2008of\\u2008Measurement\\u2008\\n[4*, c3s2] [6*, c7s5] \\nOnce the operational definitions are determined, \\nthe actual measurements need to be undertaken. \\nIt is to be noted that measurement may be car -\\nried out in four different scales: namely, nominal, \\nordinal, interval, and ratio. Brief descriptions of \\neach are given below.\\nNominal\\u2008scale: This is the lowest level of mea-\\nsurement and represents the most unrestricted \\nassignment of numerals. The numerals serve only \\nas labels, and words or letters would serve as well. \\nThe nominal scale of measurement involves only \\nclassification and the observed sampling units \\nare put into any one of the mutually exclusive \\nand collectively exhaustive categories (classes). \\nSome examples of nominal scales are: \\n• Job titles in a company \\n• The software development life cycle (SDLC) \\nmodel (like waterfall, iterative, agile, etc.) \\nfollowed by different software projects\\nIn nominal scale, the names of the different cat-\\negories are just labels and no relationship between \\nthem is assumed. The only operations that can be \\ncarried out on nominal scale is that of counting \\nthe number of occurrences in the different classes \\nand determining if two occurrences have the same \\nnominal value. However, statistical analyses may \\nbe carried out to understand how entities belong-\\ning to different classes perform with respect to \\nsome other response variable. \\nOrdinal\\u2008scale:\\u2008Refers to the measurement scale \\nwhere the different values obtained through the \\nprocess of measurement have an implicit order -\\ning. The intervals between values are not speci -\\nfied and there is no objectively defined zero \\nelement. Typical examples of measurements in \\nordinal scales are:\\n• Skill levels (low, medium, high)\\n• Capability Maturity Model Integration \\n(CMMI) maturity levels of software devel -\\nopment organizations')),\n",

However, arithmetic operations \\ncannot be carried out on variables measured in \\nordinal scales. Thus, if we measure customer sat-\\nisfaction on a 5-point ordinal scale of 5 implying \\na very high level of satisfaction and 1 implying a \\nvery high level of dissatisfaction, we cannot say \\nthat a score of four is twice as good as a score \\nof two. So, it is better to use terminology such \\nas excellent, above average, average, below aver-\\nage, and poor than ordinal numbers in order to \\navoid the error of treating an ordinal scale as a \\nratio scale. It is important to note that ordinal \\nscale measures are commonly misused and such \\nmisuse can lead to erroneous conclusions [6*, \\np274]. A common misuse of ordinal scale mea -\\nsures is to present a mean and standard deviation \\nfor the data set, both of which are meaningless. \\nHowever, we can find the median, as computation \\nof the median involves counting only.\\nInterval\\u2008scales: With the interval scale, we \\ncome to a form that is quantitative in the ordi -\\nnary sense of the word. Almost all the usual sta -\\ntistical measures are applicable here, unless they \\nrequire knowledge of a true zero point. The zero \\npoint on an interval scale is a matter of conven -\\ntion. Ratios do not make sense, but the difference \\nbetween levels of attributes can be computed and \\nis meaningful. Some examples of interval scale of \\nmeasurement follow:\\n• Measurement of temperature in different \\nscales, such as Celsius and Fahrenheit. Sup -\\npose T 1 and T 2 are temperatures measured \\nin some scale. We note that the fact that T 1 \\nis twice T2 does not mean that one object is \\ntwice as hot as another. We also note that the \\nzero points are arbitrary.\\n• Calendar dates. While the difference between \\ndates to measure the time elapsed is a mean-\\ningful concept, the ratio does not make sense.\\n• Many psychological measurements aspire to \\ncreate interval scales. Intelligence is often \\nmeasured in interval scale, as it is not neces-\\nsary to define what zero intelligence would \\nmean.\\nIf a variable is measured in interval scale, most \\nof the usual statistical analyses like mean, stan -\\ndard deviation, correlation, and regression may \\nbe carried out on the measured values.\\nRatio\\u2008scale: These are quite commonly encoun-\\ntered in physical science. These scales of mea -\\nsures are characterized by the fact that operations \\nexist for determining all 4 relations: equality, rank \\norder, equality of intervals, and equality of ratios. \\nOnce such a scale is available, its numerical val -\\nues can be transformed from one unit to another \\nby just multiplying by a constant, e.g., conversion \\nof inches to feet or centimeters. When measure -\\nments are being made in ratio scale, existence of \\na nonarbitrary zero is mandatory. All statistical \\nmeasures are applicable to ratio scale; logarithm \\nusage is valid only when these scales are used, as \\nin the case of decibels. Some examples of ratio \\nmeasures are\\n• the number of statements in a software \\nprogram\\n• temperature measured in the Kelvin (K) scale \\nor in Fahrenheit (F).\\nAn additional measurement scale, the absolute \\nscale, is a ratio scale with uniqueness of the mea-\\nsure; i.e., a measure for which no transformation \\nis possible (for example, the number of program-\\nmers working on a project).\\n3.2. Direct\\u2008and\\u2008Derived\\u2008Measures\\u2008\\n[6*, c7s5]\\nMeasures may be either direct or derived (some -\\ntimes called indirect measures). An example of \\na direct measure would be a count of how many \\ntimes an event occurred, such as the number of \\ndefects found in a software product. A derived \\nmeasure is one that combines direct measures in \\nsome way that is consistent with the measurement \\nmethod. An example of a derived measure would \\nbe calculating the productivity of a team as the \\nnumber of lines of code developed per developer-\\nmonth. In both cases, the measurement method \\ndetermines how to make the measurement. ')),\n",

Reliability\\u2008and\\u2008Validity\\n[4*, c3s4, c3s5]\\nA basic question to be asked for any measure -\\nment method is whether the proposed measure -\\nment method is truly measuring the concept with \\ngood quality. Reliability and validity are the two \\nmost important criteria to address this question.\\nThe reliability of a measurement method is \\nthe extent to which the application of the mea -\\nsurement method yields consistent measurement \\nresults. Essentially, reliability refers to the consis-\\ntency of the values obtained when the same item \\nis measured a number of times. When the results \\nagree with each other, the measurement method \\nis said to be reliable. Reliability usually depends \\non the operational definition. It can be quantified \\nby using the index of variation, which is com -\\nputed as the ratio between the standard deviation \\nand the mean. The smaller the index, the more \\nreliable the measurement results.\\nValidity refers to whether the measurement \\nmethod really measures what we intend to mea -\\nsure. Validity of a measurement method may \\nbe looked at from three different perspectives: \\nnamely, construct validity, criteria validity, and \\ncontent validity. \\n3.4. Assessing\\u2008Reliability\\u2008\\n[4*, c3s5]\\nThere are several methods for assessing reli -\\nability; these include the test-retest method, the \\nalternative form method, the split-halves method, \\nand the internal consistency method. The easi -\\nest of these is the test-retest method. In the test-\\nretest method, we simply apply the measurement \\nmethod to the same subjects twice. The correla -\\ntion coefficient between the first and second set \\nof measurement results gives the reliability of the \\nmeasurement method. \\n4. Engineering Design \\n[5*, c1s2, c1s3, c1s4]\\nA product’s life cycle costs are largely influenced \\nby the design of the product. This is true for manu-\\nfactured products as well as for software products. \\nThe design of a software product is guided by \\nthe features to be included and the quality attri -\\nbutes to be provided. It is important to note that \\nsoftware engineers use the term “design” within \\ntheir own context; while there are some common-\\nalities, there are also many differences between \\nengineering design as discussed in this section \\nand software engineering design as discussed in \\nthe Software Design KA. The scope of engineer-\\ning design is generally viewed as much broader \\nthan that of software design. The primary aim of \\nthis section is to identify the concepts needed to \\ndevelop a clear understanding regarding the pro -\\ncess of engineering design.\\nMany disciplines engage in problem solving \\nactivities where there is a single correct solu -\\ntion. In engineering, most problems have many \\nsolutions and the focus is on finding a feasible \\nsolution (among the many alternatives) that \\nbest meets the needs presented. The set of pos -\\nsible solutions is often constrained by explic -\\nitly imposed limitations such as cost, available \\nresources, and the state of discipline or domain \\nknowledge. In engineering problems, sometimes \\nthere are also implicit constraints (such as the \\nphysical properties of materials or laws of phys -\\nics) that also restrict the set of feasible solutions \\nfor a given problem.\\n4.1. Engineering\\u2008Design\\u2008in\\u2008Engineering\\u2008\\nEducation\\nThe importance of engineering design in engi -\\nneering education can be clearly seen by the high \\nexpectations held by various accreditation bod -\\nies for engineering education. Both the Cana -\\ndian Engineering Accreditation Board and the \\nAccreditation Board for Engineering and Tech -\\nnology (ABET) note the importance of including \\nengineering design in education programs. \\nThe Canadian Engineering Accreditation \\nBoard includes requirements for the amount of \\nengineering design experience/coursework that \\nis necessary for engineering students as well as \\nqualifications for the faculty members who teach \\nsuch coursework or supervise design projects. \\nTheir accreditation criteria states: ')),\n",

[8, p12]\\nIn a similar manner, ABET defines engineering \\ndesign as \\nthe process of devising a system, compo -\\nnent, or process to meet desired needs. It \\nis a decision-making process (often itera -\\ntive), in which the basic sciences, math -\\nematics, and the engineering sciences are \\napplied to convert resources optimally to \\nmeet these stated needs. [9, p4]\\nThus, it is clear that engineering design is a \\nvital component in the training and education for \\nall engineers. The remainder of this section will \\nfocus on various aspects of engineering design. \\n4.2. Design\\u2008as\\u2008a\\u2008Problem\\u2008Solving\\u2008Activity\\u2008\\n[5*, c1s4, c2s1, c3s3]\\nIt is to be noted that engineering design is primar-\\nily a problem solving activity. Design problems \\nare open ended and more vaguely defined. There \\nare usually several alternative ways to solve the \\nsame problem. Design is generally considered to \\nbe a wicked\\u2008problem—a term first coined by Horst \\nRittel in the 1960s when design methods were a \\nsubject of intense interest. Rittel sought an alterna-\\ntive to the linear, step-by-step model of the design \\nprocess being explored by many designers and \\ndesign theorists and argued that most of the prob-\\nlems addressed by the designers are wicked prob-\\nlems. As explained by Steve McConnell, a wicked \\nproblem is one that could be clearly defined only \\nby solving it or by solving part of it. This paradox \\nimplies, essentially, that a wicked problem has to \\nbe solved once in order to define it clearly and then \\nsolved again to create a solution that works. This \\nhas been an important insight for software design-\\ners for several decades [10*, c5s1].\\n4.3. Steps\\u2008Involved\\u2008in\\u2008Engineering\\u2008Design\\n[7*, c4]\\nEngineering problem solving begins when a \\nneed is recognized and no existing solution will \\nmeet that need. As part of this problem solving, \\nthe design goals to be achieved by the solution \\nshould be identified. Additionally, a set of accep-\\ntance criteria must be defined and used to deter -\\nmine how well a proposed solution will satisfy \\nthe need. Once a need for a solution to a problem \\nhas been identified, the process of engineering \\ndesign has the following generic steps:\\na) define the problem\\nb) gather pertinent information\\nc) generate multiple solutions\\nd) analyze and select a solution\\ne) implement the solution\\nAll of the engineering design steps are itera -\\ntive, and knowledge gained at any step in the \\nprocess may be used to inform earlier tasks and \\ntrigger an iteration in the process. These steps are \\nexpanded in the subsequent sections.\\na.\\u2008Define\\u2008the\\u2008problem. At this stage, the custom -\\ner’s requirements are gathered. Specific informa-\\ntion about product functions and features are also \\nclosely examined. This step includes refining the \\nproblem statement to identify the real problem to \\nbe solved and setting the design goals and criteria \\nfor success. \\nThe problem definition is a crucial stage in \\nengineering design. A point to note is that this \\nstep is deceptively simple. Thus, enough care \\nmust be taken to carry out this step judiciously. It \\nis important to identify needs and link the success \\ncriteria with the required product characteristics. \\nIt is also an engineering task to limit the scope \\nof a problem and its solution through negotiation \\namong the stakeholders.\\nb.\\u2008Gather\\u2008pertinent\\u2008information. At this stage, \\nthe designer attempts to expand his/her knowl -\\nedge about the problem. This is a vital, yet often \\nneglected, stage. Gathering pertinent information \\ncan reveal facts leading to a redefinition of the ')),\n",

This step may also involve the \\ndecomposition of the problem into smaller, more \\neasily solved subproblems.\\nWhile gathering pertinent information, care \\nmust be taken to identify how a product may be \\nused as well as misused. It is also important to \\nunderstand the perceived value of the product/\\nservice being offered. Included in the pertinent \\ninformation is a list of constraints that must be \\nsatisfied by the solution or that may limit the set \\nof feasible solutions. \\nc.\\u2008Generate\\u2008multiple\\u2008solutions. During this stage, \\ndifferent solutions to the same problem are devel-\\noped. It has already been stated that design prob-\\nlems have multiple solutions. The goal of this \\nstep is to conceptualize multiple possible solu -\\ntions and refine them to a sufficient level of detail \\nthat a comparison can be done among them. \\nd.\\u2008Analyze\\u2008and\\u2008select\\u2008a\\u2008solution. Once alternative \\nsolutions have been identified, they need to be ana-\\nlyzed to identify the solution that best suits the cur-\\nrent situation. The analysis includes a functional \\nanalysis to assess whether the proposed design \\nwould meet the functional requirements. Physical \\nsolutions that involve human users often include \\nanalysis of the ergonomics or user friendliness of \\nthe proposed solution. Other aspects of the solu -\\ntion—such as product safety and liability, an eco-\\nnomic or market analysis to ensure a return (profit) \\non the solution, performance predictions and anal-\\nysis to meet quality characteristics, opportunities \\nfor incorrect data input or hardware malfunctions, \\nand so on—may be studied. The types and amount \\nof analysis used on a proposed solution are depen-\\ndent on the type of problem and the needs that the \\nsolution must address as well as the constraints \\nimposed on the design.\\ne.\\u2008Implement\\u2008the\\u2008solution. The final phase of the \\ndesign process is implementation. Implemen -\\ntation refers to development and testing of the \\nproposed solution. Sometimes a preliminary, \\npartial solution called a prototype may be devel -\\noped initially to test the proposed design solu -\\ntion under certain conditions. Feedback resulting \\nfrom testing a prototype may be used either to \\nrefine the design or drive the selection of an alter-\\nnative design solution. One of the most impor -\\ntant activities in design is documentation of the \\ndesign solution as well as of the tradeoffs for the \\nchoices made in the design of the solution. This \\nwork should be carried out in a manner such that \\nthe solution to the design problem can be com -\\nmunicated clearly to others. \\nThe testing and verification take us back to the \\nsuccess criteria. The engineer needs to devise \\ntests such that the ability of the design to meet the \\nsuccess criteria is demonstrated. While design -\\ning the tests, the engineer must think through \\ndifferent possible failure modes and then design \\ntests based on those failure modes. The engineer \\nmay choose to carry out designed experiments to \\nassess the validity of the design.\\n5. Modeling, Simulation, and Prototyping \\n[5*, c6] [11*, c13s3] [12*, c2s3.1]\\nModeling is part of the abstraction process used \\nto represent some aspects of a system. Simula -\\ntion uses a model of the system and provides a \\nmeans of conducting designed experiments with \\nthat model to better understand the system, its \\nbehavior, and relationships between subsystems, \\nas well as to analyze aspects of the design. Mod -\\neling and simulation are techniques that can be \\nused to construct theories or hypotheses about the \\nbehavior of the system; engineers then use those \\ntheories to make predictions about the system. \\nPrototyping is another abstraction process where \\na partial representation (that captures aspects of \\ninterest) of the product or system is built. A pro -\\ntotype may be an initial version of the system but \\nlacks the full functionality of the final version. \\n5.1. Modeling\\nA model is always an abstraction of some real \\nor imagined artifact. Engineers use models in \\nmany ways as part of their problem solving \\nactivities. Some models are physical, such as a \\nmade-to-scale miniature construction of a bridge \\nor building. Other models may be nonphysical \\nrepresentations, such as a CAD drawing of a cog \\nor a mathematical model for a process. Models \\nhelp engineers reason and understand aspects of ')),\n",

They can also help engineers under -\\nstand what they do know and what they don’t \\nknow about the problem at hand.\\nThere are three types of models: iconic, ana -\\nlogic, and symbolic. An iconic model is a visu -\\nally equivalent but incomplete 2-dimensional \\nor 3-dimensional representation—for example, \\nmaps, globes, or built-to-scale models of struc -\\ntures such as bridges or highways. An iconic \\nmodel actually resembles the artifact modeled. \\nIn contrast, an analogic model is a functionally \\nequivalent but incomplete representation. That \\nis, the model behaves like the physical artifact \\neven though it may not physically resemble it. \\nExamples of analogic models include a miniature \\nairplane for wind tunnel testing or a computer \\nsimulation of a manufacturing process.\\nFinally, a symbolic model is a higher level of \\nabstraction, where the model is represented using \\nsymbols such as equations. The model captures \\nthe relevant aspects of the process or system in \\nsymbolic form. The symbols can then be used to \\nincrease the engineer’s understanding of the final \\nsystem. An example is an equation such as F\\u2008=\\u2008\\nMa. Such mathematical models can be used to \\ndescribe and predict properties or behavior of the \\nfinal system or product.\\n5.2. Simulation\\u2008\\nAll simulation models are a specification of real-\\nity. A central issue in simulation is to abstract \\nand specify an appropriate simplification of \\nreality. Developing this abstraction is of vital \\nimportance, as misspecification of the abstrac -\\ntion would invalidate the results of the simulation \\nexercise. Simulation can be used for a variety of \\ntesting purposes.\\nSimulation is classified based on the type of \\nsystem under study. Thus, simulation can be either \\ncontinuous or discrete. In the context of software \\nengineering, the emphasis will be primarily on \\ndiscrete simulation. Discrete simulations may \\nmodel event scheduling or process interaction. \\nThe main components in such a model include \\nentities, activities and events, resources, the state \\nof the system, a simulation clock, and a random \\nnumber generator. Output is generated by the \\nsimulation and must be analyzed.\\nAn important problem in the development of a \\ndiscrete simulation is that of initialization. Before \\na simulation can be run, the initial values of all \\nthe state variables must be provided. As the simu-\\nlation designer may not know what initial values \\nare appropriate for the state variables, these val -\\nues might be chosen somewhat arbitrarily. For \\ninstance, it might be decided that a queue should \\nbe initialized as empty and idle. Such a choice of \\ninitial condition can have a significant but unrec-\\nognized impact on the outcome of the simulation.\\n5.3. Prototyping\\nConstructing a prototype of a system is another \\nabstraction process. In this case, an initial version \\nof the system is constructed, often while the sys -\\ntem is being designed. This helps the designers \\ndetermine the feasibility of their design.\\nThere are many uses for a prototype, includ -\\ning the elicitation of requirements, the design and \\nrefinement of a user interface to the system, vali-\\ndation of functional requirements, and so on. The \\nobjectives and purposes for building the proto -\\ntype will determine its construction and the level \\nof abstraction used. \\nThe role of prototyping is somewhat different \\nbetween physical systems and software. With \\nphysical systems, the prototype may actually \\nbe the first fully functional version of a system \\nor it may be a model of the system. In software \\nengineering, prototypes are also an abstract \\nmodel of part of the software but are usually not \\nconstructed with all of the architectural, perfor -\\nmance, and other quality characteristics expected \\nin the finished product. In either case, prototype \\nconstruction must have a clear purpose and be \\nplanned, monitored, and controlled—it is a tech -\\nnique to study a specific problem within a limited \\ncontext [6*, c2s8]. \\nIn conclusion, modeling, simulation, and pro -\\ntotyping are powerful techniques for studying the \\nbehavior of a system from a given perspective. \\nAll can be used to perform designed experiments \\nto study various aspects of the system. How -\\never, these are abstractions and, as such, may not \\nmodel all attributes of interest.')),\n",

[13*, p8] \\nStandards provide requirements, specifica -\\ntions, guidelines, or characteristics that must be \\nobserved by engineers so that the products, pro -\\ncesses, and materials have acceptable levels of \\nquality. The qualities that various standards pro -\\nvide may be those of safety, reliability, or other \\nproduct characteristics. Standards are considered \\ncritical to engineers and engineers are expected to \\nbe familiar with and to use the appropriate stan -\\ndards in their discipline.\\nCompliance or conformance to a standard lets \\nan organization say to the public that they (or \\ntheir products) meet the requirements stated in \\nthat standard. Thus, standards divide organiza -\\ntions or their products into those that conform to \\nthe standard and those that do not. For a standard \\nto be useful, conformance with the standard must \\nadd value—real or perceived—to the product, \\nprocess, or effort.\\nApart from the organizational goals, standards \\nare used for a number of other purposes such \\nas protecting the buyer, protecting the business, \\nand better defining the methods and procedures \\nto be followed by the practice. Standards also \\nprovide users with a common terminology and \\nexpectations.\\nThere are many internationally recognized \\nstandards-making organizations including the \\nInternational Telecommunications Union (ITU), \\nthe International Electrotechnical Commission \\n(IEC), IEEE, and the International Organization \\nfor Standardization (ISO). In addition, there are \\nregional and governmentally recognized organi -\\nzations that generate standards for that region or \\ncountry. For example, in the United States, there \\nare over 300 organizations that develop stan -\\ndards. These include organizations such as the \\nAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI), \\nthe American Society for Testing and Materials \\n(ASTM), the Society of Automotive Engineers \\n(SAE), and Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL), \\nas well as the US government. For more detail \\non standards used in software engineering, see \\nAppendix B on standards.\\nThere is a set of commonly used principles \\nbehind standards. Standards makers attempt to \\nhave consensus around their decisions. There is \\nusually an openness within the community of \\ninterest so that once a standard has been set, there \\nis a good chance that it will be widely accepted. \\nMost standards organizations have well-defined \\nprocesses for their efforts and adhere to those \\nprocesses carefully. Engineers must be aware of \\nthe existing standards but must also update their \\nunderstanding of the standards as those standards \\nchange over time.\\nIn many engineering endeavors, knowing and \\nunderstanding the applicable standards is critical \\nand the law may even require use of particular \\nstandards. In these cases, the standards often rep-\\nresent minimal requirements that must be met by \\nthe endeavor and thus are an element in the con -\\nstraints imposed on any design effort.

The first step in \\nany root cause analysis effort is to identify the real \\nproblem. Techniques such as statement-restate -\\nment, why-why diagrams, the revision method, \\npresent state and desired state diagrams, and the \\nfresh-eye approach are used to identify and refine \\nthe real problem that needs to be addressed. \\nOnce the real problem has been identified, then \\nwork can begin to determine the cause of the \\nproblem. Ishikawa is known for the seven tools \\nfor quality control that he promoted. Some of \\nthose tools are helpful in identifying the causes \\nfor a given problem. Those tools are check sheets \\nor checklists, Pareto diagrams, histograms, run \\ncharts, scatter diagrams, control charts, and \\nfishbone or cause-and-effect diagrams. More \\nrecently, other approaches for quality improve -\\nment and root cause analysis have emerged.

Those factors are broken down into sub-\\nfactors and sub-subfactors until root causes can \\nbe identified.\\nA very simple approach that is useful in quality \\ncontrol is the use of a checklist. Checklists are \\na list of key points in a process with tasks that \\nmust be completed. As each task is completed, \\nit is checked off the list. If a problem occurs, \\nthen sometimes the checklist can quickly identify \\ntasks that may have been skipped or only par -\\ntially completed.\\nFinally, relations diagrams are a means for dis-\\nplaying complex relationships. They give visual \\nsupport to cause-and-effect thinking. The dia -\\ngram relates the specific to the general, revealing \\nkey causes and key effects.\\nRoot cause analysis aims at preventing the \\nrecurrence of undesirable events. Reduction of \\nvariation due to common causes requires utili -\\nzation of a number of techniques. An important \\npoint to note is that these techniques should be \\nused offline and not necessarily in direct response \\nto the occurrence of some undesirable event. \\nSome of the techniques that may be used to \\nreduce variation due to common causes are given \\nbelow.\\n1. Cause-and-effect diagrams may be used to \\nidentify the sub and sub-sub causes.\\n2. Fault tree analysis is a technique that may be \\nused to understand the sources of failures.\\n3. Designed experiments may be used to under-\\nstand the impact of various causes on the \\noccurrence of undesirable events (see Empir-\\nical Methods and Experimental Techniques \\nin this KA).\\n4. Various kinds of correlation analyses may be \\nused to understand the relationship between \\nvarious causes and their impact. These tech -\\nniques may be used in cases when conduct -\\ning controlled experiments is difficult but \\ndata may be gathered (see Statistical Analy -\\nsis in this KA).')),\n",

This document \\nwill also enable readers, reviewers, and users to \\nclearly understand what specifications were used \\nwhen developing this version of the SWEBOK \\nGuide.\\nThis document begins by situating the SWE-\\nBOK Guide as a foundational document for the \\nIEEE Computer Society suite of software engi -\\nneering products and more widely within the \\nsoftware engineering community at large. The \\nrole of the baseline and the Change Control \\nBoard is then described. Criteria and require -\\nments are defined for the breakdowns of topics, \\nfor the rationale underlying these breakdowns \\nand the succinct description of topics, and for ref-\\nerence materials. Important input documents are \\nalso identified, and their role within the project is \\nexplained. Noncontent issues such as submission \\nformat and style guidelines are also discussed. \\nTHE SWEBOK GUIDE IS A \\nFOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENT FOR THE \\nIEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY SUITE OF \\nSOFTWARE ENGINEERING PRODUCTS\\nThe SWEBOK Guide is an IEEE Computer Soci-\\nety flagship and structural document for the IEEE \\nComputer Society suite of software engineer -\\ning products. The SWEBOK Guide is also more \\nwidely recognized as a foundational document \\nwithin the software engineering community at \\nlarge notably through the official recognition of \\nthe 2004 Version as ISO/IEC Technical Report \\n19759:2005. The list of knowledge areas (KAs) \\nand the breakdown of topics within each KA is \\ndescribed and detailed in the introduction of this \\nSWEBOK Guide.\\nConsequently, the SWEBOK Guide is founda -\\ntional to other initiatives within the IEEE Com -\\nputer Society:\\na) The list of KAs and the breakdown of topics \\nwithin each KA are also adopted by the soft-\\nware engineering certification and associated \\nprofessional development products offered \\nby the IEEE Computer Society (see www.\\ncomputer.org/certification).\\nb) The list of KAs and the breakdown of top -\\nics are also foundational to the software \\nengineering curricula guidelines developed \\nor endorsed by the IEEE Computer Society \\n(www.computer.org/portal/web/education/\\nCurricula).\\nc) The Consolidated Reference List (see Appen-\\ndix C), meaning the list of recommended \\nreference materials (to the level of section \\nnumber) that accompanies the breakdown of \\ntopics within each KA is also adopted by the \\nsoftware engineering certification and asso -\\nciated professional development products \\noffered by the IEEE Computer Society.\\nBASELINE AND CHANGE CONTROL \\nBOARD\\nDue to the structural nature of the SWEBOK \\nGuide and its adoption by other products, a base-\\nline was developed at the outset of the project \\ncomprised of the list of KAs, the breakdown of ')),\n",

Change requests must be \\napproved both by the SWEBOK Guide  Editors \\nand by the CCB before being implemented. This \\nCCB is comprised of members of the initiatives \\nlisted above and acting under the authority of the \\nSoftware and Systems Engineering Committee of \\nthe IEEE Computer Society Professional Activi -\\nties Board.\\nCRITERIA AND REQUIREMENTS FOR \\nTHE BREAKDOWN OF TOPICS WITHIN \\nA KNOWLEDGE AREA\\na) KA Editors are instructed to adopt the base -\\nline breakdown of topics.\\nb) The breakdown of topics is expected to be \\n“reasonable,” not “perfect.”\\nc) The breakdown of topics within a KA must \\ndecompose the subset of the Software Engi -\\nneering Body of Knowledge that is “gen -\\nerally recognized.” See below for a more \\ndetailed discussion of this point. \\nd) The breakdown of topics within a KA must \\nnot presume specific application domains, \\nbusiness needs, sizes of organizations, organi-\\nzational structures, management philosophies, \\nsoftware life cycle models, software technolo-\\ngies, or software development methods. \\ne) The breakdown of topics must, as much \\nas possible, be compatible with the vari -\\nous schools of thought within software \\nengineering. \\nf) The breakdown of topics within a KA must \\nbe compatible with the breakdown of soft -\\nware engineering generally found in indus -\\ntry and in the software engineering literature \\nand standards. \\ng) The breakdown of topics is expected to be as \\ninclusive as possible. \\nh) The SWEBOK Guide  adopts the position \\nthat even though the following “themes” are \\ncommon across all Knowledge Areas, they \\nare also an integral part of all Knowledge \\nAreas and therefore must be incorporated \\ninto the proposed breakdown of topics of \\neach Knowledge Area. These common \\nthemes are measurement, quality (in gen -\\neral), and security. \\ni) The breakdown of topics should be at most \\ntwo or three levels deep. Even though no \\nupper or lower limit is imposed on the num -\\nber of topics within each KA, a reasonable \\nand manageable number of topics is expected \\nto be included in each KA. Emphasis should \\nalso be put on the selection of the topics \\nthemselves rather than on their organization \\nin an appropriate hierarchy.\\nj) Topic names must be significant enough \\nto be meaningful even when cited outside the \\nSWEBOK Guide. \\nk) The description of a KA will include a chart \\n(in tree form) describing the knowledge \\nbreakdown.\\nCRITERIA AND REQUIREMENTS FOR \\nDESCRIBING TOPICS\\nTopics need only be sufficiently described so the \\nreader can select the appropriate reference mate -\\nrial according to his/her needs. Topic descrip -\\ntions must not be prescriptive.\\nCRITERIA AND REQUIREMENTS FOR \\nREFERENCE MATERIAL\\na) KA Editors are instructed to use the refer -\\nences (to the level of section number) allo -\\ncated to their KA by the Consolidated Refer-\\nence List as their Recommended References.\\nb) There are three categories of reference \\nmaterial:\\n » Recommended References. The set of \\nRecommended References (to the level \\nof section number) is collectively known \\nas the Consolidated Reference List. \\n » Further Readings.\\n » Additional references cited in the KA \\nDescription (for example, the source \\nof a quotation or reference material in \\nsupport of a rationale behind a particular \\nargument).')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={'source': '../Docs/swebokv3.pdf', 'page': 297}, page_content='Appendix A A-3\\nc) The SWEBOK Guide is intended by defini -\\ntion to be selective in its choice of topics \\nand associated reference material. The list of \\nreference material should be clearly viewed \\nas an “informed and reasonable selection” \\nrather than as a definitive list.\\nd) Reference material can be book chapters, \\nrefereed journal papers, refereed confer -\\nence papers, refereed technical or industrial \\nreports, or any other type of recognized arti -\\nfact. References to another KA, subarea, or \\ntopic are also permitted.\\ne) Reference material must be generally avail -\\nable and must not be confidential in nature. \\nf) Reference material must be in English. \\ng) Criteria and requirements for recommended \\nreference material or Consolidated Refer -\\nence List:\\n » Collectively the list of Recommended \\nReferences should be\\ni. complete: covering the entire \\nscope of the SWEBOK Guide\\nii. sufficient: providing enough \\ninformation to describe “gener -\\nally accepted” knowledge\\niii. consistent: not providing contra -\\ndictory knowledge nor conflict -\\ning practices\\niv. credible: recognized as providing \\nexpert treatment\\nv. current: treating the subject in \\na manner that is commensurate \\nwith currently generally accepted \\nknowledge\\nvi. succinct: as short as possible \\n(both in number of reference \\nitems and in total page count) \\nwithout failing other objectives.\\n » Recommended reference material must \\nbe identified for each topic. Each recom-\\nmended reference item may of course \\ncover multiple topics. Exceptionally, a \\ntopic may be self-descriptive and not cite \\na reference material item (for example, a \\ntopic that is a definition or a topic for \\nwhich the description itself without any \\ncited reference material is sufficient for \\nthe objectives of the SWEBOK Guide). \\n » Each reference to the recommended \\nreference material should be as precise \\nas possible by identifying what specific \\nchapter or section is relevant.\\n » A matrix of reference material (to the \\nlevel of section number) versus topics \\nmust be provided.\\n » A reasonable amount of recommended \\nreference material must be identified \\nfor each KA. The following guidelines \\nshould be used in determining how \\nmuch is reasonable: \\ni. If the recommended reference \\nmaterial were written in a coher -\\nent manner that followed the pro-\\nposed breakdown of topics and in \\na uniform style (for example, in a \\nnew book based on the proposed \\nKA description), an average tar -\\nget across all KAs for the number \\nof pages would be 750. However, \\nthis target may not be attainable \\nwhen selecting existing reference \\nmaterial due to differences in \\nstyle and overlap and redundancy \\nbetween the selected reference \\nmaterials.\\nii. In other words, the target for the \\nnumber of pages for the entire \\ncollection of recommended refer-\\nences of the SWEBOK Guide  is \\nin the range of 10,000 to 15,000 \\npages.\\niii. Another way of viewing this is \\nthat the amount of recommended \\nreference material would be \\nreasonable if it consisted of the \\nstudy material on this KA for a \\nsoftware engineering licensing \\nexam that a graduate would pass \\nafter completing four years of \\nwork experience. \\nh) Additional reference material can be \\nincluded by the KA Editor in a “Further \\nReadings” list: ')),\n",

Further readings \\ncould include: new versions of an exist-\\ning reference already included in the \\nrecommended references, alternative \\nviewpoints on a KA, or a seminal treat -\\nment of a KA.\\n » A general guideline to be followed is 10 \\nor fewer further readings per KA.\\n » There is no matrix of the reference \\nmaterials listed in further readings and \\nthe breakdown of topics. \\ni) Criteria and requirements regarding addi -\\ntional references cited in the KA Description:\\n » The SWEBOK Guide  is not a research \\ndocument and its readership will be var-\\nied. Therefore, a delicate balance must \\nbe maintained between ensuring a high \\nlevel of readability within the document \\nwhile maintaining its technical excel -\\nlence. Additional reference material \\nshould therefore only be brought in by \\nthe KA Editor if it is necessary to the \\ndiscussion. Examples are to identify the \\nsource of a quotation or to cite reference \\nitem in support of a rationale behind a \\nparticular and important argument.\\nCOMMON STRUCTURE\\nKA descriptions should use the following structure: \\n• Acronyms\\n• Introduction\\n• Breakdown of Topics of the KA (including a \\nfigure describing the breakdown)\\n• Matrix of Topics vs. Reference Material\\n• List of Further Readings\\n• References\\nWHAT DO WE MEAN BY “GENERALLY \\nRECOGNIZED KNOWLEDGE”?\\nThe Software Engineering Body of Knowledge \\nis an all-inclusive term that describes the sum \\nof knowledge within the profession of software \\nengineering. However, the SWEBOK Guide seeks \\nto identify and describe that subset of the body \\nof knowledge that is generally recognized or, in \\nother words, the core body of knowledge. To bet-\\nter illustrate what “generally recognized” knowl-\\nedge is relative to other types of knowledge, \\nFigure A.1 proposes a three-category schema for \\nclassifying knowledge.\\nThe Project Management Institute in its Guide \\nto\\u2008the\\u2008Project\\u2008Management\\u2008Body\\u2008of\\u2008Knowledge \\ndefines “generally recognized” knowledge for \\nproject management as being:\\nthat subset of the project management \\nbody of knowledge generally recognized \\nas good practice. “Generally recognized” \\nmeans the knowledge and practices \\ndescribed are applicable to most projects \\nmost of the time, and there is consensus \\nabout their value and usefulness. “Good \\npractice” means there is general agreement \\nthat the application of these skills, tools, \\nand techniques can enhance the chances \\nof success over a wide range of projects. \\n“Good practice” does not mean that the \\nknowledge described should always be \\napplied uniformly to all projects; the orga-\\nnization and/or project management team \\nis responsible for determining what is \\nappropriate for any given project. [1]\\n“Generally accepted” knowledge could also be \\nviewed as knowledge to be included in the study \\nmaterial of a software engineering licensing exam \\n(in the USA) that a graduate would take after \\ncompleting four years of work experience. These \\ntwo definitions should be seen as complementary.\\nKA Editors are also expected to be somewhat \\nforward looking in their interpretation by tak -\\ning into consideration not only what is “gener -\\nally recognized” today and but what they expect \\nwill be “generally recognized” in a 3- to 5-year \\ntimeframe.')),\n",

One \\nseldom listens to a briefing on the subject without \\nsuffering some apparently obligatory joke that \\nthere are too many of them. However, the exis -\\ntence of standards takes a very large (possibly \\ninfinite) trade space of alternatives and reduces \\nthat space to a smaller set of choices—a huge \\nadvantage for users. Nevertheless, it can still be \\ndifficult to choose from dozens of alternatives, so \\nsupplementary guidance, like this appendix, can \\nbe helpful. A summary list of the standards men-\\ntioned in this appendix appears at the end.\\nTo reduce tedium in reading, a few simplifica -\\ntions and abridgements are made in this appendix:\\n• ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 maintains nearly two \\nhundred standards on the subject. IEEE \\nmaintains about fifty. The two organizations \\nare in the tenth year of a systematic program \\nto coordinate and integrate their collections. \\nIn general, this article will focus on the stan-\\ndards that are recognized by both organiza -\\ntions, taking this condition as evidence that \\nwide agreement has been obtained. Other \\nstandards will be mentioned briefly.\\n• Standards tend to have long, taxonomical \\ntitles. If there were a single standard for \\nbuilding an automobile, the one for your \\nCamry probably would be titled something \\nlike, “Vehicle, internal combustion, four-\\nwheel, passenger, sedan.” Also, modern stan-\\ndards organizations provide their standards \\nfrom databases. Like any database, these \\nsometimes contain errors, particularly for the \\ntitles. So this article will often paraphrase the \\ntitle of the standard or simply use its number. \\nIn obtaining a standard of interest, the reader \\nshould rely on the number, not the title, given \\nin this article. For reasons of consistency, the \\narticle will use the IEEE’s convention for the \\ncapitalization of titles—nouns, pronouns, \\nadjectives, verbs, adverbs, and first and last \\nwords have an initial capital letter—despite \\nthe fact that IEEE and ISO/IEC use differing \\nconventions.\\n• Because these standards are being continu -\\nally revised to take account of new technolo-\\ngies and usage patterns, this article will be \\nobsolescent before it is published. Therefore, \\nit will occasionally discuss standards that \\nhave not yet been published, if they are likely \\nto assume significant importance.\\n• Explicit trademarks are omitted. Suffice it to \\nsay that IEEE places a trademark on all of its \\nstandards’ designations.\\nThere are some other conventions of interest:\\n• In both IEEE and ISO/IEC, standards for \\nsystems engineering are maintained by the \\nsame committee as those for software engi-\\nneering. Many of the standards apply to both. \\nSo, instead of making fine distinctions, this \\narticle will deal with both.\\n• On the other hand, both S2ESC and SC 7 \\n(see below for descriptions of these orga -\\nnizations) are responsible for standards \\nthat don’t qualify as “engineering.” In the \\nUS and many other countries, the services \\nof a licensed engineer are required when a \\nproduct might affect public safety, health, ')),\n",

This appendix \\nwill respect that distinction and ignore stan -\\ndards that appear to be merely economic in \\nconsequence. \\n• User documentation is assumed to be devel -\\noped similarly to software. For example, \\na standard concerning the design of user \\ndocumentation is described in the Software \\nDesign KA.\\n• Some jointly developed standards are explic-\\nitly labeled as joint developments, e.g., ISO/\\nIEC/IEEE 24765. In other cases, the stan -\\ndards have different designations in the two \\norganizations. Examples include\\n » IEEE Std. 12207:2008 (a.k.a. ISO/IEC \\n12207:2008), where “a.k.a.” (“also \\nknown as”) is this appendix’s abbrevia -\\ntion to note the designation in the other \\norganization;\\n » IEEE Std. 15939:2008 Standard Adop -\\ntion of ISO/IEC 15939:2007, an adop -\\ntion by IEEE of a standard developed in \\nISO/IEC;\\n » IEEE Std. 1220:2005 (a.k.a. ISO/IEC \\n26702:2007), a “fast-track” by ISO/IEC \\nof a standard developed in IEEE.\\nIn each of these cases, the standards are \\nsubstantively identical in the two orga -\\nnizations, differing only in front matter \\nand, occasionally, added informational \\nmaterial.\\nA summary list of all of the mentioned stan -\\ndards is provided at the end of this appendix.\\nISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7, SOFTWARE AND \\nSYSTEMS ENGINEERING\\nISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 is the major source of \\ninternational standards on software and systems \\nengineering. Its name is formed taxonomically. \\nJoint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) is a child \\nof the International Organization for Standardiza-\\ntion (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical \\nCommission (IEC); it has the scope of “informa-\\ntion technology” and subdivides its work among \\na number of subcommittees; Subcommittee 7 (SC \\n7) is the one responsible for software and sys -\\ntems engineering. SC 7, and its working groups, \\nmeets twice a year, attracting delegations repre -\\nsenting the national standards bodies of partici -\\npating nations. Each nation follows its own pro -\\ncedures for determining national positions and \\neach nation has the responsibility of determining \\nwhether an ISO/IEC standard should be adopted \\nas a national standard.\\nSC 7 creates three types of documents:\\n• International Standards: Documents contain-\\ning requirements that must be satisfied in \\norder to claim conformance.\\n• Technical Specifications (formerly called \\nTechnical Reports, type 1 and type 2): Docu-\\nments published in a preliminary manner \\nwhile work continues.\\n• Technical Reports (formerly called Techni -\\ncal Reports, type 3): Documents inherently \\nunsuited to be standards, usually because \\nthey are descriptive rather than prescriptive.\\nThe key thing to remember is that only the \\nfirst category counts as a consensus standard. \\nThe reader can easily recognize the others by the \\nsuffix TS or TR prepended to the number of the \\ndocument.\\nIEEE SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS \\nENGINEERING STANDARDS \\nCOMMITTEE (S2ESC)\\nIEEE is the world’s largest organization of tech -\\nnical professionals, with about 400,000 members \\nin more than 160 countries. The publication of \\nstandards is performed by the IEEE Standards \\nAssociation (IEEE-SA), but the committees that \\ndraft and sponsor the standards are in the various \\nIEEE societies; S2ESC is a part of the IEEE Com-\\nputer Society. IEEE is a global standards maker \\nbecause its standards are used in many differ -\\nent countries. Despite its international member -\\nship (about 50% non-US), though, the IEEE-SA \\nroutinely submits its standards to the American \\nNational Standards Institute (ANSI) for endorse -\\nment as “American National Standards.” Some \\nS2ESC standards are developed within S2ESC, \\nsome are developed jointly with SC 7, and some \\nare adopted after being developed by SC 7.')),\n",

IEEE-SA does have the concept of a “Trial-\\nUse” standard, which is roughly comparable to \\nan ISO/IEC Technical Specification. However, it \\nhas nothing comparable to an ISO/IEC Techni -\\ncal Report; one would look elsewhere in IEEE for \\ndocuments of this ilk.\\nTHE STANDARDS\\nThe remainder of this article allocates the selected \\nstandards to relevant knowledge areas (KAs) of \\nthe SWEBOK Guide. There is a section for each \\nKA. Within each section, the relevant standards \\nare listed—the ones that principally apply to the \\nKA as well as others that principally apply to \\nother KAs but which are also related to the cur -\\nrent one. Following each standard is a brief sum-\\nmary. In most cases, the summary is a quotation \\nor paraphrase of the abstract or other introductory \\nmaterial from the text of the standard.\\nMost of the standards easily fit into one KA. \\nSome fit into more than one; in such cases, \\na cross-reference is provided. Two standards \\napply to all KAs, so they are listed in a category \\ncalled “General.” All of the standards related to \\ncomputer-aided software engineering (CASE) \\ntools and environments are listed in the Software \\nEngineering Models and Methods KA section.\\nGENERAL\\nThe first two standards are so central that they \\ncould be slotted into all of the KAs. Two more are \\ndescribed in the Software Engineering Process \\nKA, but are mentioned here because they provide \\na helpful framework and because the descriptions \\nof several other standards refer to them. \\nISO/IEC TR 19759 is the SWEBOK Guide  \\nitself. It’s not an IEEE standard because, lacking \\nprescriptive verbs, it doesn’t satisfy the criteria \\nfor any of the IEEE categories. In ISO/IEC, it is a \\n“technical report”—defined as a document inher-\\nently unsuited to be a standard. The 2004 IEEE \\nSWEBOK Guide was adopted by ISO/IEC with -\\nout change.

These situ -\\nations include traditional software construction \\nactivities (when design leads to code) and reverse \\nengineering situations (when a design description \\nis recovered from an existing implementation). \\nThis standard can be applied to commercial, sci -\\nentific, or military software that runs on digital \\ncomputers. Applicability is not restricted by the \\nsize, complexity, or criticality of the software. \\nThis standard can be applied to the description \\nof high-level and detailed designs. This stan -\\ndard does not prescribe specific methodologies \\nfor design, configuration management, or qual -\\nity assurance. This standard does not require the \\nuse of any particular design languages, but estab-\\nlishes requirements on the selection of design \\nlanguages for use in an SDD. This standard can \\nbe applied to the preparation of SDDs captured as \\npaper documents, automated databases, software \\ndevelopment tools, or other media.\\nBy convention, this appendix treats user docu -\\nmentation as a part of a software system. There -\\nfore, the various aspects of user documentation—\\nits design, its testing, and so forth—are allocated \\nto different KAs. The next standard deals with the \\ndesign of user documentation.\\nIEEE Std. 26514-2010 Standard Adoption of ISO/\\nIEC 26514:2008 Systems and Software Engineer -\\ning—Requirements for Designers and Developers of \\nUser Documentation\\nThis standard provides requirements for the \\ndesign and development of software user docu -\\nmentation as part of the life cycle processes. It \\ndefines the documentation process from the view-\\npoint of the documentation developer and also \\ncovers the documentation product. It specifies the \\nstructure, content, and format for user documen -\\ntation and also provides informative guidance for \\nuser documentation style. It is independent of the \\nsoftware tools that may be used to produce docu-\\nmentation and applies to both printed documenta-\\ntion and onscreen documentation. Much of this \\nstandard is also applicable to user documentation \\nfor systems including hardware.\\nSOFTWARE CONSTRUCTION\\nThe term “software construction” refers to the \\ndetailed creation of working, meaningful software \\nthrough a combination of coding, verification, \\nunit testing, integration testing, and debugging. \\nThere are few standards on the details of soft -\\nware coding. It has been found through (mostly \\nbad) experience that coding conventions are not \\nappropriate for standardization because, in most \\ncases, the real benefit comes from the consis -\\ntency of applying an arbitrary convention rather \\nthan the convention itself. So, although coding \\nconventions are a good idea, it is generally left \\nto the organization or the project to develop such \\na standard.\\nNevertheless, the subject of secure coding has \\nattracted attention in recent years because some \\ncoding idioms are insecure in the face of attack. \\nA Technical Report prepared by ISO/IEC JTC 1/\\nSC 22 (programming languages) describes vul -\\nnerabilities in programming languages and how \\nthey can be avoided. \\nISO/IEC TR 24772:2013 Information Technology—\\nProgramming Languages —Guidance to Avoiding \\nVulnerabilities in Programming Languages through \\nLanguage Selection and Use\\nISO/IEC TR 24772:2013 specifies software pro -\\ngramming language vulnerabilities to be avoided \\nin the development of systems where assured \\nbehavior is required for security, safety, mis -\\nsion-critical, and business-critical software.

A VSE is defined as \\nan enterprise, organization, department, or proj -\\nect having up to 25 people. A set of standards and \\nguides has been developed according to a set of \\nVSEs’ characteristics and needs. The guides are \\nbased on subsets of appropriate standards ele -\\nments, referred to as VSE profiles. The purpose \\nof a VSE profile is to define a subset of ISO/IEC \\ninternational standards relevant to the VSEs’ \\ncontext.\\nISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-2:2011 provides the \\nmanagement and engineering guide to the basic \\nVSE profile applicable to VSEs that do not \\ndevelop critical software.

The 1074 \\nstandard explains how to define processes for \\nuse on a given project. The 12207 and 15288 \\nstandards, however, focus on defining processes \\nfor organizational adoption and repeated use on \\nmany projects.

Its \\nterminology differs from the ISO/IEC series, but \\nit is substantially more compact.\\nIEEE Std. 1061-1998 Standard for Software Quality \\nMetrics Methodology\\nA methodology for establishing quality require -\\nments and identifying, implementing, analyzing, \\nand validating the process and product software \\nquality metrics is defined. The methodology \\nspans the entire software life cycle.\\nOne approach to achieving software quality is \\nto perform an extensive program of verification \\nand validation. IEEE Std. 1012 is probably the \\nworld’s most widely applied standard on this sub-\\nject. A revision was recently published.\\nIEEE Std. 1012-2012 Standard for System and Soft-\\nware Verification and Validation\\nVerification and validation (V&V) processes are \\nused to determine whether the development prod-\\nucts of a given activity conform to the require -\\nments of that activity and whether the product \\nsatisfies its intended use and user needs. V&V life \\ncycle process requirements are specified for differ-\\nent integrity levels. The scope of V&V processes \\nencompasses systems, software, and hardware, and \\nit includes their interfaces. This standard applies to \\nsystems, software, and hardware being developed, \\nmaintained, or reused [legacy, commercial off-the-\\nshelf (COTS), nondevelopmental items]. The term \\nsoftware also includes firmware and microcode, \\nand each of the terms system, software, and hard-\\nware includes documentation. V&V processes \\ninclude the analysis, evaluation, review, inspec -\\ntion, assessment, and testing of products.\\nThere are other standards that support the veri-\\nfication and validation processes. One describes \\ntechniques for performing reviews and audits \\nduring a software project.\\nIEEE Std. 1028-2008 Standard for Software Reviews \\nand Audits\\nFive types of software reviews and audits, \\ntogether with procedures required for the execu -\\ntion of each type, are defined in this standard. \\nThis standard is concerned only with the reviews \\nand audits; procedures for determining the neces-\\nsity of a review or audit are not defined, and the \\ndisposition of the results of the review or audit \\nis not specified. Types included are management \\nreviews, technical reviews, inspections, walk-\\nthroughs, and audits.')),\n",

The following standard suggests how \\nanomalies should be classified.\\nIEEE Std. 1044-2009 Standard for Classification for \\nSoftware Anomalies\\nThis standard provides a uniform approach to the \\nclassification of software anomalies, regardless \\nof when they originate or when they are encoun -\\ntered within the project, product, or system life \\ncycle. Classification data can be used for a vari -\\nety of purposes, including defect causal analy -\\nsis, project management, and software process \\nimprovement (e.g., to reduce the likelihood of \\ndefect insertion and/or increase the likelihood of \\nearly defect detection).\\nIn some systems, one particular property of the \\nsoftware is so important that it requires special \\ntreatment beyond that provided by a conven -\\ntional verification and validation program. The \\nemerging term for this sort of treatment is “sys -\\ntems and software assurance.” Examples include \\nsafety, privacy, high security, and ultrareliability. \\nThe 15026 standard is under development to deal \\nwith such situations. The first part of the four-part \\nstandard provides terminology and concepts used \\nin the remaining parts. It was first written before \\nthe other parts and is now being revised for com-\\nplete agreement with the others.\\nIEEE Std. 15026.1-2011 Trial-Use Standard Adop -\\ntion of ISO/IEC TR 15026-1:2010 Systems and Soft-\\nware Engineering—Systems and Software Assur -\\nance—Part 1: Concepts and Vocabulary\\nThis trial-use standard adopts ISO/IEC TR \\n15026-1:2010, which defines terms and estab -\\nlishes an extensive and organized set of concepts \\nand their relationships for software and systems \\nassurance, thereby establishing a basis for shared \\nunderstanding of the concepts and principles cen-\\ntral to ISO/IEC 15026 across its user communi -\\nties. It provides information to users of the sub -\\nsequent parts of ISO/IEC 15026, including the \\nuse of each part and the combined use of multiple \\nparts. Coverage of assurance for a service being \\noperated and managed on an ongoing basis is not \\ncovered in ISO/IEC 15026.\\nThe second part of the standard describes the \\nstructure of an “assurance case,” which is intended \\nas a structured argument that the critical property \\nhas been achieved. It is a generalization of various \\ndomain-specific constructs like “safety cases.”\\nIEEE Std. 15026.2-2011 Standard Adoption of ISO/\\nIEC 15026-2:2011 Systems and Software Engineer-\\ning—Systems and Software Assurance—Part 2: \\nAssurance Case\\nISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 is adopted by this stan -\\ndard. ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 specifies minimum \\nrequirements for the structure and contents of an \\nassurance case to improve the consistency and \\ncomparability of assurance cases and to facili -\\ntate stakeholder communications, engineering \\ndecisions, and other uses of assurance cases. An \\nassurance case includes a top-level claim for a \\nproperty of a system or product (or set of claims), \\nsystematic argumentation regarding this claim, \\nand the evidence and explicit assumptions that \\nunderlie this argumentation. Arguing through \\nmultiple levels of subordinate claims, this struc -\\ntured argumentation connects the top-level claim \\nto the evidence and assumptions. Assurance \\ncases are generally developed to support claims \\nin areas such as safety, reliability, maintain -\\nability, human factors, operability, and security, \\nalthough these assurance cases are often called \\nby more specific names, e.g., safety case or reli -\\nability and maintainability (R&M) case. ISO/IEC \\n15026-2:2011 does not place requirements on \\nthe quality of the contents of an assurance case \\nand does not require the use of a particular termi-\\nnology or graphical representation. Likewise, it \\nplaces no requirements on the means of physical \\nimplementation of the data, including no require-\\nments for redundancy or colocation.\\nIn many systems, some portions are critical to \\nachieving the desired property while others are only ')),\n",

For example, the flight control system of \\nan airliner is critical to safety, but the microwave \\noven is not. Conventionally, the various portions \\nare assigned “criticality levels” to indicate their sig-\\nnificance to the overall achievement of the property. \\nThe third part of ISO/IEC 15026 describes how that \\nis done. This part will be revised for better fit with \\nthe remainder of the 15026 standard.\\nISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 Systems and Software Engi-\\nneering—Systems and Software Assurance—Part 3: \\nSystem Integrity Levels\\nISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 specifies the concept of \\nintegrity levels with corresponding integrity level \\nrequirements that are required to be met in order \\nto show the achievement of the integrity level. It \\nplaces requirements on and recommends meth -\\nods for defining and using integrity levels and \\ntheir integrity level requirements, including the \\nassignment of integrity levels to systems, soft -\\nware products, their elements, and relevant exter-\\nnal dependences.\\nISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 is applicable to sys -\\ntems and software and is intended for use by:\\n• definers of integrity levels such as industry \\nand professional organizations, standards \\norganizations, and government agencies;\\n• users of integrity levels such as developers \\nand maintainers, suppliers and acquirers, \\nusers, and assessors of systems or software, \\nand for the administrative and technical sup-\\nport of systems and/or software products.\\nOne important use of integrity levels is by sup-\\npliers and acquirers in agreements; for example, \\nto aid in assuring safety, economic, or security \\ncharacteristics of a delivered system or product.\\nISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 does not prescribe a \\nspecific set of integrity levels or their integrity \\nlevel requirements. In addition, it does not pre -\\nscribe the way in which integrity level use is inte-\\ngrated with the overall system or software engi -\\nneering life cycle processes.\\nISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 can be used alone or \\nwith other parts of ISO/IEC 15026. It can be used \\nwith a variety of technical and specialized risk \\nanalysis and development approaches. ISO/IEC \\nTR 15026-1 provides additional information and \\nreferences to aid users of ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011.\\nISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 does not require the \\nuse of the assurance cases described by ISO/IEC \\n15026-2 but describes how integrity levels and \\nassurance cases can work together, especially in \\nthe definition of specifications for integrity levels \\nor by using integrity levels within a portion of an \\nassurance case.\\nThe final part of 15026 provides additional \\nguidance for executing the life cycle processes of \\n12207 and 15288 when a system or software is \\nrequired to achieve an important property.\\nISO/IEC 15026-4:2012 Systems and Software Engi-\\nneering—Systems and Software Assurance—Part 4: \\nAssurance in the Life Cycle\\nThis part of ISO/IEC 15026 gives guidance and \\nrecommendations for conducting selected pro -\\ncesses, activities and tasks for systems and software \\nproducts requiring assurance claims for properties \\nselected for special attention, called critical proper-\\nties. This part of ISO/IEC 15026 specifies a prop-\\nerty-independent list of processes, activities, and \\ntasks to achieve the claim and show the achieve -\\nment of the claim. This part of ISO/IEC 15026 \\nestablishes the processes, activities, tasks, guidance, \\nand recommendations in the context of a defined \\nlife cycle model and set of life cycle processes for \\nsystem and/or software life cycle management.\\nThe next standard deals with a property—\\nsafety—that is often identified as critical. It was \\noriginally developed in cooperation with the US \\nnuclear power industry.\\nIEEE Std. 1228-1994 Standard for Software Safety \\nPlans\\nThe minimum acceptable requirements for the \\ncontent of a software safety plan are established. \\nThis standard applies to the software safety plan \\nused for the development, procurement, mainte -\\nnance, and retirement of safety-critical software.

Begin at www.iso.org/\\niso/store.htm, then click on “browse standards \\ncatalogue,” then “browse by TC,” then “JTC 1,” \\nthen “SC 7.”\\nFinding the current list of standards for S2ESC \\nis a bit more difficult. Begin at http://standards.\\nieee.org/. In the search box under “Find Stan -\\ndards,” type “S2ESC.” This should produce a \\nlist of published standards for which S2ESC is \\nresponsible. \\nKeep in mind that the searchable databases \\nare compilations. Like any such database, they \\ncan contain errors that lead to incomplete search \\nresults.\\nWHERE TO OBTAIN THE STANDARDS\\nSome readers will want to obtain standards \\ndescribed in this article. The first thing to \\nknow is that some international standards are \\navailable free for individual use. The current \\nlist of ISO/IEC standards available under these \\nterms is located at http://standards.iso.org/ittf/\\nPubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html.\\nOne of the publicly available standards is the \\nISO/IEC adoption of the SWEBOK Guide, ISO/\\nIEC 19759.\\nThe definitions contained in ISO/IEC/IEEE \\n24765, System\\u2008 and\\u2008 Software\\u2008Vocabulary, are \\nfreely available at www.computer.org/sevocab.\\nHowever, the vast majority of standards are not \\nfree. ISO/IEC standards are generally purchased \\nfrom the national standards organization of the \\ncountry in which one lives. For example, in the \\nUS, international standards can be purchased \\nfrom the American National Standards Institute \\nat http://webstore.ansi.org/. Alternatively, stan -\\ndards can be purchased directly from ISO/IEC \\nat www.iso.org/iso/store.htm. It should be noted \\nthat each individual nation is free to set its own \\nprices, so it may be helpful to check both sources.\\nIEEE standards may be available to you for \\nfree if your employer or library has a subscription \\nto IEEE Xplore: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/. Some \\nsubscriptions to Xplore provide access only to \\nthe abstracts of standards; the full text may then \\nbe purchased via Xplore. Alternatively, standards \\nmay be purchased via the IEEE standards store at \\nwww.techstreet.com/ieeegate.html. It should be \\nnoted that IEEE-SA sometimes bundles standards \\ninto groups available at a substantial discount.\\nFinally, the reader should note that standards \\nthat IEEE has adopted from ISO/IEC, standards \\nthat ISO/IEC has “fast-tracked” from IEEE, and \\nstandards that were jointly developed or revised \\nare available from both sources. For all standards \\ndescribed in this article, the IEEE version and the \\nISO/IEC version are substantively identical. The \\nrespective versions may have different front and \\nback matter but the bodies are identical.\\nWHERE TO SEE THE SWEBOK GUIDE\\nThe SWEBOK Guide is published under an IEEE \\ncopyright.
